        The sample applications demonstrate the use of various TrueZIP module
        APIs.
        Some of them use rather advanced or exotic features which makes them
        more complex than would be expected from a typical application.
        As by design, the sample applications can use all file system drivers
        which can be loaded from the class path at runtime.
        Enumeration of the available file system drivers is performed by
        scanning the class path for files with the name
        {@code "META-INF/services/de.schlichtherle.truezip.fs.spi.FsDriverService"}
        and instantiating any class named in them.
