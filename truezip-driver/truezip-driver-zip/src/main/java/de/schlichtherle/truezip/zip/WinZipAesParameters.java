     * <a href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/aes_info.htm">AES Encryption Information: Encryption Specification AE-1 and AE-2</a>
     * does not specify how password strings should get encoded to bytes.

     * WinZip AES entries you have written.
     * This could even be your future self when you are using another
     * application or platform then!
     * <p>
     * There are several reasonable schemes you could chose to encode password
     * characters to bytes:
     * <ul>
     * <li>You could follow the recommendation in the document
     *     <a href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/aes_tips.htm">AES Coding Tips for Developers</a>
     *     and limit the character set to the non-control characters of
     *     US-ASCII.
     *     However, this severely limits the password search space for brute
     *     force attacks.
     * <li>You could use the same character set which is used to encode entry
     *     names and comments in the ZIP file, e.g. UTF-8 or CP437.
     *     This should be the preferred choice, but would not conform
     *     to WinZip's recommendation.
     *     In the case of encodings other than UTF-8, this would still limit
     *     the password search space, but not as much as US-ASCII.
     * <li>If you are not concerned about interoperability with authorized
     *     third parties, including yourself when using another application or
     *     platform, then you could simply use UTF-8.
     *     This would provide the largest password search space and follow the
     *     convention for JAR files, but again, this would not conform to
     *     WinZip's recommendation.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * A reasonable alternative implementation could encode the given char
     * array using the same character set which is used to encode entry names
     * and comments, e.g. UTF-8 or CP437.
