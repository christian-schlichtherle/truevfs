//
// Implementation notes:
//
// In order to provide optimum performance, this class implements a read ahead
// strategy with lazy decryption.
// So the encrypted data of the file is read ahead into an internal window
// buffer in order to minimize file access.
// Upon request by the application only, this buffer is then decrypted block by
// block into the buffer provided by the application.
//
// For similar reasons, this class is NOT a subclass of
// BufferedReadOnlyFile though their algorithm and code is pretty similar.
// In fact, this class uses an important performance optimization:
// Whenever possible, encrypted data in the window buffer is directly
// decrypted into the user provided buffer.
// If BufferedReadOnlyFile would be used as the base class instead, we would
// have to provide another buffer to copy the data into before we could
// actually decrypt it, which is redundant.
