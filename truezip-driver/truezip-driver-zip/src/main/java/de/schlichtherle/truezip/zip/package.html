        <p>
            A drop-in replacement for the classes in the package
            {@link java.util.zip} for reading and writing ZIP files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classes in this package read and write ZIP files according to
            a subset of PKWARE's
            <a href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">
                ZIP File Format Specification
            </a>,
            Version 6.3.2 from September 28, 2007.
            The subset has been selected in order to achieve the following
            objectives:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Full interoperability with ZIP files read or written by the
                package {@link java.util.zip} of Sun's Java SE&nbsp;7
                implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for arbitrary character sets, in particular
                IBM Code Page 437 (alias IBM PC) for PKZIP compatibility
                and UTF-8 for Java Archive (JAR) compatibility.
                Note that using any other character set except CP437 or UTF-8
                is strongly discouraged because it will result in
                interoperability issues with third party tools, especially
                when sharing archive files between different locales!
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for reading and writing ZIP64 extensions with the
                following restrictions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The maximum file size is {@link java.lang.Long#MAX_VALUE}.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum number of entries in the Central Directory
                        is {@link java.lang.Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The offsets in ZIP64 files must respect a preamble if
                        present, i.e. they must by exact.
                        This is in contrast to ZIP32 files where the offsets
                        do not need to respect a preamble if present.
                        Preambles are primarily used to contain self extracting
                        (SFX) executable code.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.zip.ZipFile} supports
                reading archive data from the random access read only
                interface {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.rof.ReadOnlyFile},
                which allows to read archive data from composite data sources
                like e.g. RAES encrypted ZIP files directly without the need
                to decrypt them to a temporary file first.
            </li>
        </ul>
