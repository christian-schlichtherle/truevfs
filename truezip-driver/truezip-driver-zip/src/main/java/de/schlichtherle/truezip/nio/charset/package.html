        <p>
            Provides an implementation of the {@code IBM437} character set.
            This is the original IBM PC character set for the USA, also known
            as {@code CP437}, and is the original character set used in ZIP
            files.
        </p>
        <p>
            This implementation is provided because the IBM437 character set
            does not need to be present in a JRE.
            In Sun's JRE, if installed, it's contained in
            {@code lib/charsets.jar} in the JRE home directory.
