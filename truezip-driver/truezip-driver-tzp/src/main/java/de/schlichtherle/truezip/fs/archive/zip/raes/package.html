        <p>The archive driver family for RAES encrypted ZIP files,
            alias TZP files.
            TZP files are regular ZIP files which use UTF-8 as their character
            set (like JARs) and have been wrapped in a RAES file format
            envelope.
            The RAES File Format enables transparent, random access to AES
            encrypted data (the payload) in the file as if the application were
            reading decrypted data from a {@link java.io.RandomAccessFile}.
            Note that RAES is not specific to ZIP files - any kind of content
            could get encrypted.</p>
