    <body>
        <p>Provides an extensible manager for generic keys required to
            create or open protected resources.
            Its primary objective is to decouple...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                the process to retrieve keys required to open or create
                protected resources from...
            </li>
            <li>
                the process to use and verify these keys.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process to retrieve keys is executed by the (abstract) classes
            and interfaces in this package.</p>
        <p>The process to use and optionally authenticate keys is executed by
            the users of this package - called <i>client applications</i> or
            <i>clients</i> for short.</p>
        <p>A protected resource can be anything which can be referenced by a
            {@link java.net.URI}: As an example, it could be a URL to an AES
            encrypted file which the client application is going to create or
            overwrite.
            The key could be a password or a key file entered or selected by
            the user.</p>
