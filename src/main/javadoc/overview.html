            TrueZIP is a plug-in framework for virtual file systems which
            provides transparent access to archive files as if they were just
            plain directories.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an API, TrueZIP provides uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
            directories in a file system path.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a framework, TrueZIP provides the interfaces and classes to
            write file system drivers which plug-in to its federated file
            system space.
