        <p>TrueZIP is a Java based virtual file system (VFS) which enables
            client applications to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            operations on archive files as if they were virtual directories,
            even with nested archive files in multithreaded environments.</p>
        <p>As a library, TrueZIP provides simple, uniform, transparent,
            thread-safe, read/write access to archive files as if they were
            virtual directories in a file system path.</p>
        <p>As a framework, TrueZIP provides the interfaces and classes to
            write file system drivers which plug-in to its federated file
            system space.</p>
