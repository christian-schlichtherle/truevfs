        <p>TrueVFS is a virtual file system (VFS) for Java&nbsp;7 which enables
            client applications to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            operations on archive files as if they were virtual directories,
            even with nested archive files in multithreaded environments.</p>
        <p>As a library, TrueVFS provides simple, uniform, transparent,
            thread-safe, read/write access to archive files as if they were
            virtual directories in a file system path.</p>
        <p>As a framework, TrueVFS provides the API to write file system
            drivers which plug-in to its federated file system space.</p>
