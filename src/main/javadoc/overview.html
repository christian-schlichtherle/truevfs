        <p>TrueZIP is a framework for virtual file systems and a library for
            accessing archive files as if they were just plain old
            directories.</p>
        <p>As a framework, TrueZIP provides the interfaces and classes to write
            file system drivers which plug-in to its federated file system space.</p>
        <p>As a library, TrueZIP's File* API provides convenient multi-threaded
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain old
            directories in a file system path.</p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Core Concept and Definitions</h2>
        <p>The core concept of TrueZIP is the federation of virtual file
            systems into a file system space which can be transparently
            accessed via uniform calls to a convenient and comprehensive API.
            To understand what this means, let's check the following
            definitions first:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>File System</dt>
            <dd>An atomic, persistent container for files and directories in
                order to store and structure arbitrary data.
                Normally, the operating system provides an application with the
                means to access a set of one or more file systems like NTFS or
                ext4.</dd>
            <dt>Virtual File System</dt>
            <dd>A component which provides the same services like a file
                system, but is synthesized at run time from one or more
                components which are <em>not</em> file systems by
                themselves.</dd>
            <dt>Federated File System</dt>
            <dd>A file system with a root directory which is a member within
                another (parent) file system, which may be federated, too.</dd>
            <dt>File System Space</dt>
            <dd>The union of all file systems.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Note that the attributes <i>virtual</i> and <i>federated</i> in
            their strict sense are complementary, so a file system could be
            one or the other or both at the same time.</p>
        <p>As an example for a file system which is virtual, but not federated,
            consider the HTTP(S) protocols:
            With their methods PUT, GET, POST and DELETE and the URI adressing
            scheme, the HTTP(S) protocols provide a subset of typical file
            system services.</p>
        <p>As an example for a file system which is federated, but not virtual,
            consider a native Unix file system which is mounted at a directory
            path within the operating system's file system space, like e.g.
            {@code /mnt/cdrom}.</p>
        <p>As an example for a file system which is both virtual and federated,
            consider any archive file which is accessed via TrueZIP's API:
            It's virtual because it's adapted to typical file system services
            by TrueZIP and its federated because its a file member within
            another file system - which is a native file system of the
            operating system in most cases.</p>
        <p>Within the context of TrueZIP, the terms
            <i>federated virtual file system</i>,
            <i>virtual federated file system</i> and
            <i>federated file system</i> are used as synonyms.
            This simplification should do no harm because as a Java
            application, TrueZIP provides only federated file systems which
            are virtual file systems at the same time, too.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Easy To Use</dt>
            <dd>The File* API provides convenient read/write access to archive
                files as if they were just plain old directories in a file
                system path. Using the classes
                {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.file.TFile},
                {@code de.schlichtherle.truezip.file.TFileInputStream},
                {@code de.schlichtherle.truezip.file.TFileOutputStream} et al,
                you can instantly access ZIP files, TAR files and their
                derivatives or your own custom archive file format.</dd>
            <dt>Fast Bulk I/O</dt>
            <dd>The File* API provides convenient and powerful methods for fast
                bulk I/O operations like recursive copying, moving or deleting
                of directory trees and files.
                E.g. using the multi-threaded method
                {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.file.TFile#cat(java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream)},
                you'll never have to write a naive read-then-write copy loop
                again.
            </dd>
            <dt>File System Federation</dt>
            <dd>TrueZIP supports virtual file system federation.
                This enables an application to access archive files within any
                other virtual file systems, e.g. you could read the contents of
                a ZIP file which is accessed via HTTP(S) instead of reading it
                from a file.
                Archive files may also be nested, i.e. contained in another
                archive file.
                This is a generalization of the concept implemented by the
                class {@link java.net.JarURLConnection}.</dd>
            <dt>Extensible Driver Architecture</dt>
            <dd>TrueZIP supports any virtual file system type via its pluggable
                {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.fs.FsDriver file system driver}
                architecture.
                TrueZIP ships with file system drivers for HTTP(S), ZIP, TAR
                and their derivatives (JAR, TGZ, TBZ2 etc).</dd>
            <dt>Thread-Safe</dt>
            <dd>Multiple threads can read and write the same archive
                file at the same time.</dd>
            <dt>Robust</dt>
            <dd>TrueZIP code uses assertions, JUnit tests and static code
                analysis tools like FindBugs and JDepend in order to achieve
                its high reliability standards.</dd>
            <dt>Encrypted Archive File Format</dt>
            <dd>TrueZIP includes a reference implementation for it's custom
                Random Access Encryption Specification (RAES).
                RAES is a generic wrapper file format which supports SHA-256
                authentication and AES-256 encryption in CTR block mode for
                random read access.
                When combined with the ZIP File Format, this results in the
                encrypted archive file format called ZIP.RAES or TZP for short.
                TrueZIP ships with a file system driver to enable transparent
                read/write access to TZP files.</dd>
