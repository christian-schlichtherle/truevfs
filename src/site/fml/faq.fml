                <p>
                    When configured correctly, the File* API will treat an
                    archive file like a virtual directory (that's what TrueZIP
                    is all about).
                    Like with plain directories, applications cannot read or
                    write virtual directories using an input or output stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use one of the 
                    <code>list*(*)</code> methods in the
                    <code>TFile</code> class instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to list the contents of the top level
                    (virtual) directory of the archive file
                    <code>archive.zip</code>, you could use...

                    Use one of the

                    <code>TFile</code> class or directly write to the entry
                    within the archive file using a
                    <code>TFileOutputStream</code> instead.
                    For example, to (over)write the entry 
                    <code>entry</code> within the archive file

                    your application before.
                    In this case, you would need to create the archive file

        <faq id="cannotCopyFileToArchive">
            <question>
                Copying a file to an archive file does not seem to work.
                What's wrong?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Users often assume that when copying a file to an archive
                    file, the File* API would automatically complete the path
                    name of the destination archive file so that it ends with
                    the base name of the source file.
                    This is probably assumed because that's how it works with
                    command line utilities like 
                    <code>cp</code> on POSIX or
                    <code>copy</code> on Windows.
                    However, this is not true:
                    The File* API does 
                    <em>never</em> do path name completion.
                    Hence, the following code may behave unexpectedly:
                </p>
<source>
TFile src = new TFile(string1); // e.g. "file"
TFile dst = new TFile(string2); // e.g. "archive.zip"
src.cp_rp(dst);
</source>
                <p>
                    If successful, this would only result in a verbatim copy of 
                    <code>file</code> to 
                    <code>archive.zip</code>, which is probably unexpected.
                    However, the way the copy command line utilities work can
                    be easily emulated by using the following instead:
                </p>
<source>
TFile src = new TFile(string1); // e.g. "file"
TFile dst = new TFile(string2); // e.g. "archive.zip"
if (TFile.isLenient() &amp;&amp; dst.isArchive() || dst.isDirectory())
    dst = new TFile(dst, src.getName());
src.cp_rp(dst);
</source>
                <p>
                    This will append the base name of the source path to the
                    destination path if either the destination path name ends
                    with a recognized archive file suffix like e.g. ".zip" or
                    if the destination file system entry already exists as a
                    directory.
                    If 
                    <code>TFile.setLenient(false)</code> is never called by
                    your application, then you could shorten this to...
                </p>
<source>
TFile src = new TFile(string1); // e.g. "file"
TFile dst = new TFile(string2); // e.g. "archive.zip"
if (dst.isArchive() || dst.isDirectory())
    dst = new TFile(dst, src.getName());
src.cp_rp(dst);
</source>
                <p>
                    If you don't like path name completion for non-existent
                    files which just look like archive files according to their
                    file name, then you could even shorten this to...
                </p>
<source>
TFile src = new TFile(string1); // e.g. "file"
TFile dst = new TFile(string2); // e.g. "archive.zip"
if (dst.isDirectory())
    dst = new TFile(dst, src.getName());
src.cp_rp(dst);

        <faq id="filterTArchiveDetector">
            <question>
                The set of detected suffixes for archive files is too large.
                How can I change it?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    You can easily filter the set of canonical suffixes
                    installed by the file system driver modules on the run time
                    class path.
                    For example, the TrueZIP Driver ZIP module will install a
                    large set of canonical file suffixes for ZIP files.
                    If all you want is to detect <code>*.zip</code> files
                    however, you can do so easily using the following statement:
                </p>

TFile.setDefaultArchiveDetector(new TArchiveDetector("zip"));

            <question>
                The API is not detecting an archive file as a virtual directory.
                What's wrong?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Most likely the TrueZIP File* module is not set up
                    correctly in order to detect the file suffix of the archive
                    type you want to access.
                    To make sure it does, call the following somewhere at the
                    start of your application:
                </p>
<source>
TFile.setDefaultArchiveDetector(
        new TArchiveDetector(
            TArchiveDetector.NULL,
            new Object[][] {
                { "tar", new TarDriver(IOPoolLocator.SINGLETON) },
                { "tgz|tar.gz", new TarGZipDriver(IOPoolLocator.SINGLETON) },

        <faq id="ignoreArchiveFile">
            <question>
                The API should <em>not</em> detect a particular archive file as
                a virtual directory.
                How can I do this?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Every now and then you might want to treat an archive file
                    like a regular file rather than a virtual directory.
                    For example, when trying to obtain the length of the
                    archive file in bytes.
                    You would normally do this by calling the method
                    <code>File.length()</code>.
                    However, if the <code>File</code> object is an instance of
                    the <code>TFile</code> class and the path has been detected
                    to name a valid archive file, then this method always
                    returns 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can change this behavior easily by creating a
                    <code>TFile</code> with <code>TArchiveDetector.NULL</code>
                    as an additional constructor parameter.
                    For example, you could use the following method to convert
                    an archive-detecting <code>TFile</code> to
                    a non-archive-detecting <code>TFile</code>:
                </p>
<source>
static TFile newNonArchiveFile(TFile file) {
    return new TFile(file.getParentFile(), file.getName(),
                     TArchiveDetector.NULL);
}
</source>
                <p>
                    Here, <code>TArchiveDetector.NULL</code> is used to scan
                    only the file name of the parameter <code>file</code>.
                    Because this archive detector never detects a prospective
                    archive file, any prospective archive file will get ignored.
                    This will work even in the parent directory is an archive
                    file or a directory within an archive file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mind you that using the resulting <code>TFile</code> object
                    for any I/O bypasses any state associated with the archive
                    file in the TrueZIP Kernel module.
                    This may result in an inconsistent state of the federated
                    file system space and may even incur <em>loss of data</em>!
                    In order to avoid this, it's a good idea to unmount the
                    archive file like this before accessing the resulting
                    <code>TFile</code> object:
                </p>
<source>
TFile archive = new TFile("archive.zip");
... // there may be some I/O here
TFile file = newNonArchiveFile(archive);
if (archive.isArchive()) // prospective archive file?
    TFile.umount(archive); // unmount it
// Now you can safely do any I/O to $file.
// Mind that it may refer to an entry in another archive file,
// so make sure to use a TFileInputStream.
InputStream in = new TFileInputStream(file);
try {
    ... // read the archive file like a plain file here
} finally {
    in.close();
}

        <faq id="corruptedArchive">
            <question>
                When I create or update archive entries,
                the modified archive file gets corrupted.
                What's wrong?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    The TrueZIP Kernel module applies neat caching and
                    buffering strategies for archive entries.
                    So whenever your application creates or updates archive
                    entries, the changes need to get committed to the archive
                    file when done.
                    On certain events, e.g. whenever the JVM terminates
                    normally with or without a throwable (= doesn't crash),
                    this happens automatically.
                    However, in a long running application you may want to do
                    this manually in order to allow <i>third parties</i> to
                    access the archive file.
                    The term <i>third party</i> in this context includes any
                    other process in the operating system and even the plain
                    <code>File*</code> API.

                <p>
                    The TrueZIP File* API can only access the platform file

                    You can't because there is no addressing scheme for this.
                    For example, the expression
                    <code>new TFile("archive.zip/entry")</code> gets decomposed
                    into the file system path <code>archive.zip</code> as the
                    mount point of the archive file and the relative entry name
                    <code>entry</code> as the entry name within this archive
                    file.
                    There's no expression to address the absolute entry name
                    <code>/entry</code> within the archive file instead.
                    Even if you tried
                    <code>new TFile("archive.zip//entry")</code>, it would
                    just get normalized to the previous expression.

        <faq id="interoperability">
            <question>
                Can I use the APIs of the modules TrueZIP Path and
                TrueZIP File* concurrently?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Absolutely yes, because both module APIs are just facades
                    for the module TrueZIP Kernel.
                    The NIO.2 API defines some methods for the interoperability
                    of <code>File</code> and <code>Path</code> objects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Path.toFile()</code> returns a <code>File</code>
                        object for this <code>Path</code>.
                        However, according to the interface contract for this
                        method, it's supposed to work with the default file
                        system provider only (e.g. if it's a
                        <code>WindowsPath</code>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>File.toPath()</code> returns a <code>Path</code>
                        object for this <code>File</code>.
                        However, according to the interface contract for this
                        method, the returned object is associated with the
                        default file system provider (e.g. it's a
                        <code>WindowsPath</code>).
                        Furthermore, this method puts a compile time dependency
                        on the NIO.2 API.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To solve these issues, in TrueZIP this is implemented as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>TPath.toFile()</code> returns a <code>TFile</code>
                        object for this <code>TPath</code>.
                        This works for any (virtual) file system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To avoid a compile time dependency in the TrueZIP File*
                        module on the TrueZIP Path module,
                        <code>TFile.toPath()</code> throws an
                        <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>.
                        To create a <code>TPath</code> from a
                        <code>File</code> object, call
                        <code>new TPath(File)</code> instead.
                        Note that this works for plain <code>File</code>
                        objects too, not just <code>TFile</code> objects.

        <faq id="whichCopy">
            <question>
                The NIO.2 API and the TrueZIP File* API both provide a copy
                method. Which one should I use?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Currently, the NIO.2 API supports only the copying of a
                    single file: <code>Files.copy(Path, Path, CopyOption)</code>.
                    Unfortunately, these methods use a simple
                    read-then-write-in-a-loop implementation which results in
                    bad performance.
                    Furthermore, there are no methods for recursive copying of
                    directory trees, so you'ld have to write this yourselve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With TrueZIP however, you can easily &quot;back out&quot;
                    from a <code>TPath</code> object to a <code>TFile</code>
                    object to use the advanced copy methods of the TrueZIP
                    File* API.
                    So instead of calling...
                </p>
<source>
Path src = ...
Path dst = ...
Files.copy(src, dst, REPLACE_EXISTING);
</source>
                <p>
                    You could call...

TFile.cp(src.toFile(), dst.toFile());
</source>
                <p>
                    in order to benefit from its superior performance.
                    Likewise, you could call any other
                    <code>TFile.cp*(*)</code> method, e.g.
                    <code>TFile.cp_r(File src, File dst, TArchiveDetector detector)</code>
                    for recursive copying of a directory tree.

        <faq id="ignoreArchivePath">
            <question>
                The API should <em>not</em> detect a particular archive file as
                a virtual directory.
                How can I do this?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Every now and then you might want to treat an archive file
                    like a regular file rather than a virtual directory.
                    For example, when trying to obtain the length of the
                    archive file in bytes.
                    You would normally do this by calling the method
                    <code>Files.size(Path path)</code>.
                    However, if the <code>Path</code> object is an instance of
                    the <code>TPath</code> class and the path has been detected
                    to name a valid archive file, then this method always
                    returns 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can change this behavior easily by creating a
                    <code>TPath</code> with <code>TArchiveDetector.NULL</code>
                    in the current configuration on the inheritable thread
                    local stack.
                    For example, you could use the following method to convert
                    an archive-detecting <code>TPath</code> to
                    a non-archive-detecting <code>TPath</code>:
                </p>
<source>
static TPath newNonArchiveFile(TPath file) {
    TConfig config = TConfig.push();
    try {
        config.setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL);
        return path.resolveSibling(path.getFileName());
    } finally {
        config.close();
    }
}
</source>
                <p>
                    Here, <code>TArchiveDetector.NULL</code> is used to scan
                    only the file name of the parameter <code>file</code>.
                    Because this archive detector never detects a prospective
                    archive file, any prospective archive file will get ignored.
                    This will work even in the parent directory is an archive
                    file or a directory within an archive file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mind you that using the resulting <code>TFile</code> object
                    for any I/O bypasses any state associated with the archive
                    file in the TrueZIP Kernel module.
                    This may result in an inconsistent state of the federated
                    file system space and may even incur <em>loss of data</em>!
                    In order to avoid this, it's a good idea to unmount the
                    archive file like this before accessing the resulting
                    <code>TPath</code> object:
                </p>
<source>
TPath archive = new TPath("archive.zip");
... // there may be some I/O here
TPath file = newNonArchiveFile(archive);
archive.getFileSystem().close(); // unmount prospective archive file
// Now you can safely do any I/O to $file.
// Mind that it may refer to an entry in another archive file,
// so make sure to use a TFileInputStream.
try (InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(file)) {
    ... // read the archive file like a plain file here
}

                How does TrueZIP deal with binary compatibility?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    TrueZIP uses the same version numbering scheme like Maven,
                    i.e.
                    <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;incremental&gt;-&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>.
                    Within the same major version number, binary compatibility
                    should be retained so that recompilation of a client
                    application should not be necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is one exception:
                    Binary compatibility may be broken in a subsquent release
                    if all of the following conditions apply:

        <faq id="nestedArchives">
            <question>
                How does TrueZIP deal with the compression of nested archive
                files like e.g. <code>app.war/WEB-INF/lib/lib.jar</code>?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    With the advent of release 7.1, TrueZIP implements a new
                    strategy to avoid compressing already compressed archive
                    files in an enclosing archive file again.
                    In contrast, the old stragegy of TrueZIP 7.0 and earlier
                    was to compress everything - even if it was already
                    compressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new strategy results in a better overall compression
                    ratio than the old strategy because compressing already
                    compressed data again just inflates the data a bit because
                    of some algorithm specific overhead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the example in the question, the new strategy uses the
                    DEFLATE method to compress the entries of the inner archive
                    file <code>lib.jar</code> while it uses the STORE method
                    for the corresponding entry <code>WEB-INF/lib/lib.jar</code>
                    within the outer archive file <code>app.war</code>.
                    This behavior is in conformance to the JEE specs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new strategy is implemented by the archive drivers, so
                    it works best with all supported archive types.
                    For example, when storing a TAR file within a ZIP file,
                    the ZIP entry for the TAR file would use the DEFLATE
                    method because the TAR driver knows that plain TAR
                    files are not compressed.
                    In contrast, when storing a TAR.GZ file within a ZIP file,
                    the ZIP entry for the TAR.GZ file would use the STORE
                    method because the TAR.GZ driver knows that TAR.GZ
                    files are already compressed.

            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    As answered <a href="#accessAbsoluteEntryName">here</a>,
                    you cannot access entries with absolute entry names in
                    archive files.
                    This implies that you cannot create archive files which
                    contain entries with absolute entry names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, you can use TrueZIP to read, modify or delete
                    archive files which contain entries with absolute entry
                    names:
                    If you use TrueZIP to modify an archive file which
                    contains entries with absolute entry names, these entry 
                    names are preserved.
                    Likewise, an archive file can get deleted like any empty
                    directory if it contains only entries with absolute entry
                    names.

            <question>
                How does TrueZIP deal with entries with dot <code>"."</code>
                or dot-dot <code>".."</code> segments in archive files?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Wherever possible, redundant segments are removed by a
                    normalization of the entry name
                    before the corresponding archive entry is mounted into the
                    file system.
                    When updating the archive file however, the original
                    archive entry name is preserved.
                    If a dot-dot segment remains at the start of the entry name,
                    the corresponding entry will not be accessible by the
                    application, but preserved with its original entry name
                    upon an update of its archive file.

            <question>
                How does TrueZIP deal with entries which use <code>"\"</code>
                as the separator character in archive files?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Any occurence of this illegal separator character is
                    replaced by the correct separator character <code>"/"</code>
                    before the entry name is
                    <a href="#normalizeEntryName">normalized</a> and the
                    corresponding archive entry is mounted into the file system.
                    When updating the archive file however, the original
                    archive entry name is preserved.

                How does TrueZIP deal with duplicate entries in archive files?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    When mounting an archive file system, TrueZIP 7.1 and later
                    use <i>covariant file system entries</i> in order to enable
                    an application to access archive entries of different types
                    (FILE, DIRECTORY, SYMLINK or SPECIAL) which share the same
                    <a href="#normalizeEntryName">normalized</a> entry name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the ZIP and TAR file formats use a trailing
                    slash <code>'/'</code> character in entry names to indicate
                    a directory entry.
                    In case an archive file contains two entries which, after
                    normalization of their name, differ only in a trailing
                    slash character, then both archive entries are mounted into
                    a covariant file system entry for the otherwise equal
                    normalized entry name.
                    Then, an application can read the contents of the file
                    entry by using e.g.
                    <a href="apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFileInputStream.html"><code>TFileInputStream</code></a>
                    and list the members of the directory entry by using
                    <a href="apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFile.html#listFiles()"><code>TFile.listFiles()</code></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this feature solely exists to enable applications
                    to read the contents of all archive files, even if they
                    have a strange directory layout.
                    Note again that a TrueZIP application cannot create a
                    covariant archive entry because this is considered to be a
                    bad practice.
