Overview

    TrueZIP is a framework for virtual file systems and a library for
    accessing archive files as if they were just plain old
    directories.

    As a framework, TrueZIP provides the interfaces and classes to write
    file system drivers which plug-in to its federated file system space.

    As a library, TrueZIP's File* API provides convenient multi-threaded
    read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain old
    directories in a file system path.
