{TrueZIP 5.0.1 has been released}

    (January 24th, 2006)

    This is a minor bug fix release.

    A regression bug has been fixed which caused the <<<nzip>>>
    utility main class to identify ZIP and RAES encrypted ZIP files only
    instead of all known ZIP compatible file types (i.e. EAR, JAR, WAR, ZIP
    and RAES encrypted ZIP files).
