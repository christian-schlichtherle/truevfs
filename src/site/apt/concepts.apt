Basic Concepts

    TrueZIP is a Java based plug-in framework for virtual file systems (VFS)
    which provides transparent access to archive files as if they were just
    plain directories.

* Overall Architecture

    TrueZIP applies the (in)famous three-tier architecture pattern:

    [[1]] The <Access Tier> is a facade for the Kernel Tier which provides
          convenient-to-use client APIs for TrueZIP applications.
          No file system state is managed by this tier, which enables a TrueZIP
          application to work with any client API concurrently.
          This tier consists of the modules
          {{{./truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP&#160;File*}}
          and
          {{{./truezip-path/index.html}TrueZIP&#160;Path}}
          (since TrueZIP 7.2).
          In addition to the canonical term <access module>, each of these may
          also get referred to by the term <client API module> for better
          comprehensibility.

    [[1]] The <Kernel Tier> manages all virtual file system state.
          It also provides multiplexing, caching and buffering for
          multithreaded environments so that the driver tier does not need to
          take care of this.
          This tier solely consists of the module
          {{{./truetip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP&#160;Kernel}}.

    [[1]] The <Driver Tier> implements the I/O operations for their respective
          (federated) file system type.
          This tier consists of all file system driver modules, e.g.
          {{{./truezip-driver/truezip-driver-file/index.html}TrueZIP&#160;Driver&#160;FILE}},
          {{{./truezip-driver/truezip-driver-zip/index.html}TrueZIP&#160;Driver&#160;ZIP}}
          et al.

* Design Paradigms

    The TrueZIP project employs several high level design paradigms which have
    proven to be beneficial.
    However, these are only guidelines - not rules - so they should get applied
    with some care.

** Convention Over Configuration

    The decomposition of this framework into separate modules enables users to
    easily configure the initial setup of the application's archive detection
    by simply putting the JARs of the required file system driver modules on
    the run time class path.
    This will cause the application to automatically detect the canonical file
    extension for the archive files supported by the respective file system
    driver modules - no configuration file editing is required.

    The application can simply accept this
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TArchiveDetector.html#ALL}initial setup}}
    of the
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TConfig.html#getArchiveDetector()}archive detection}}
    in its 
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TConfig.html#get()}current configuration}}
    or it can
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TConfig.html#setArchiveDetector(de.schlichtherle.truezip.file.TArchiveDetector)}explicitly override}}
    it.
    Check the {{{./faq.html#file}FAQ}} for the
    {{{./truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP File*}}
    API for a discussion of some options to adapt the archive detection to your
    needs.

** Service Location

    As an implication of the Convention Over Configuration design paradigm,
    the
    {{{./truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP Kernel}}
    module provides service locator singletons for the
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/sl/FsManagerLocator.html}file system manager}},
    the
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/sl/FsDriverLocator.html}file system drivers}}
    and the
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/socket/sl/IOPoolLocator.html}temporary I/O buffer pool}}.

    File system drivers may add additional service locators singletons.
    For example, the
    {{{./truezip-driver/truezip-driver-tzp/index.html}TrueZIP Driver ZIP.RAES (TZP)}}
    module adds another service locator singleton for the
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/key/sl/KeyManagerLocator.html}key manager}}
    which obtains passwords or key files required to encrypt and decrypt
    RAES encrypted ZIP files.

** Dependency Injection

    Although the service locator singletons are provided by the TrueZIP Kernel
    module, it does not actually use them.
    To the contrary, the TrueZIP Kernel module fully relies on the Dependency
    Injection design paradigm.
    This enables TrueVFS modules and TrueVFS applications to inject custom
    implementations or simply the service locator singletons as a dependency
    into the TrueVFS Kernel.

    For example, the file system manager service locator singleton and the file
    system driver service locator singleton are used by the APIs of the TrueZIP
    File* and
    {{{./truezip-path/index.html}TrueZIP Path}}
    modules in order to implement the Convention Over Configuration design
    paradigm.
    Likewise, the temporary I/O entry pool service locator singleton is used by
    the file system driver modules.

    No Dependency Injection framework is used in order to reduce TrueZIP's
    dependency on third party projects.

    Constructor injection is favored wherever possible in order to enable
    immutable objects.

** Immutable Classes

    Immutable classes are favored wherever possible because they inherently
    provide support for multithreading,
    which is a key requirement for most TrueZIP Kernel classes.

    For example, the classes
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsPath.html}<<<FsPath>>>}},
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsMountPoint.html}<<<FsMountPoint>>>}}
    and
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsEntryName.html}<<<FsEntryName>>>}}
    are immutable so that their instances can get safely shared among many
    objects and threads.

** Loose Coupling

    Programming against interfaces or abstract classes is preferred over
    implementation classes in order to ease exchanging implementation classes.

    For example, the abstract classes
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsModel.html}<<<FsModel>>>}}
    and
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsController.html}<<<FsController>>>}}
    participate in a variant of the MVC design pattern which is known as the
    Front Controller design pattern.
    The numerous implementation classes participate in the different file
    system driver modules in order to accommodate to the different contexts
    of non-federated and federated file system types and implement their
    specific behavior.

** Open For Extension, Closed For Modification

    Abstract classes are favored over interfaces wherever the future addition
    of more methods is anticipated in order to enable binary backwards
    compatibility.

    Wherever reasonable, classes, methods and fields are declared (package)
    private and/or final in order to inhibit undesirable inheritance, enhance
    maintainability and/or enable true immutability.

    For example, the abstract classes <<<FsModel>>> and <<<FsController>>>
    provide final implementations for <<<Object.equals(Object)>>>,
    <<<Object.hashCode()>>> and <<<Object.toString()>>> because there is
    exactly only one reasonable implementation for any implementation class.

** Separation Of Concerns

    The design of interfaces and abstract classes aims for strong cohesion in
    order to ease implementation classes and enhance their extensibility and
    reusability.
    Where conflicts arise, the Law Of Demeter is sacrificed for strong cohesion.

    The set of overridable public methods of abstract classes and interfaces is
    reduced as much as reasonable in order to ease implementation classes.

    For example, the abstract class
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsDriver.html}<<<FsDriver>>>}}
    consists of only one abstract method
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsDriver.html#newController(de.schlichtherle.fs.FsModel,de.schlichtherle.fs.FsController)}<<<FsDriver.newController(FsModel, FsController)>>>}}
    which needs to get implemented in any file system driver module.    

** Composition Over Inheritance

    The declaration of classes or methods as final forces the use of
    composition rather than inheritance which in turn enables dependency
    resolution at run time and thus enhances the overall extensibility of the
    architecture.
