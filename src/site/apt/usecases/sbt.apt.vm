    See how easy "tarring" a directory can be:

+--+
new TFile("directory").cp_rp(new TFile("archive.tar.gz"));
+--+

    The name of the method <<<TFile.cp_rp(*)>>> is modeled after the Unix
    command line <<<cp -rp>>> which copies its arguments recursively and
    preserves all file attributes.

    However, in order to prevent ambiguities, unlike the <<<cp>>> command line
    utility, TrueVFS does not support auto-completion of path names or mixing
    file and directory parameters.
    So you must provide <complete path names> for both the source and the
    destination.
    E.g. in order to copy a single file to an archive file, you would have to
    call something like this:

+--+
new TFile("file").cp_rp(new TFile("archive.tar.gz/file"));
+--+

    The <<<TFile>>> class provides many alternative constructors and methods to
    ease the tasks of constructing complete path names and copy files or
    directories - please consult the
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html}Javadoc}}
    for more information.

    The type of the prospective archive file is detected by its
    extension in a path name.
    In this case <<<.tar.gz>>> was used, but you could use any other
    registered archive file extension, too (see below).
    And of course, archive files can not only be used as the destination of a
    copy method, but also as the source or both.
    So here's how to unzip a ZIP file to a directory:

+--+
new TFile("archive.zip").cp_rp(new TFile("directory"));
+--+

    And here's how to "transform" a ZIP file into a TAR.GZ file:

+--+
new TFile("archive.zip").cp_rp(new TFile("archive.tar.gz"));
+--+
