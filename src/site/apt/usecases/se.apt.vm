    See how easy listing the contents of the top level directory of an archive
    file can be:

+--+
TFile[] entries = new TFile("archive.zip").listFiles();
+--+

    Because this is identical to the code for reading plain directories in the
    file system, the required code size shrinks drastically.
    Now you only need to apply recursion to traverse the directory tree of
    any archive file.

    Indexing the contents of any entry within an archive file works exactly the
    same way as it would work for plain files in the file system by using the
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileReader.html}<<<TFileReader>>>}}
    class

+--+
TFile entry = ...;
try (Reader reader = new TFileReader(entry)) {
    ...;
}
+--+

    You may be glad to know that this works recursively, too.
    So <<<entry>>> may refer to a plain file, an entry in an archive file or an
    entry in an archive file which is contained in another archive file and so
    on.
