Application File Format

* Motivation

    Suppose you're writing a plug-in for the next generation application
    which shall use an archive file format with a custom file extension
    (extension) as a persistent container for some application data, e.g. a
    text document.

    Then, wouldn't it be nice if you wouldn't need to worry about how to read
    or write archive files using cumbersome archive type specific APIs?

* Accessing Application File Formats

    Thanks to the client API of the module
    {{{../truevfs-access/index.html}TrueVFS Access}},
    here's your relief:
    The
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFileInputStream.html}<<<TFileInputStream>>>}}
    and
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFileOutputStream.html}<<<TFileOutputStream>>>}}
    classes can read and write entries within an
    archive file as if they were plain files in regular directories in the file
    system.

    First, you need to register your custom application file format extension
    with an instance of an archive driver class like this:

+--+
TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(
    new TArchiveDetector(
        "foo|bar",
        new JarDriver(IOPoolLocator.SINGLETON)));
+--+

    Once this has been called, any new <<<TFile>>> object will recognize the
    file extensions <<<foo>>> and <<<bar>>>, whereby case is ignored,
    and assume the JAR file format to read or write these files.

    Note that TrueVFS automatically recognizes false positive archive files,
    so it cannot get confused by files with arbitrary content which accidently
    use the extensions of your custom application file format.

    Please also note the usage of the class
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/driver/zip/JarDriver.html}<<<JarDriver>>>}}
    for accessing the JAR file format.
    The JAR file format is typically the best choice for custom application
    file formats because it supports compression, fast access and UTF-8 encoded
    entry names for maximum interoperability.
    In particular, the last point makes it superior to the ZIP file format.

    Now you can easily create or overwrite an entry in your custom application
    file format like this:

+--+
OutputStream out = new TFileOutputStream("file.foo/contents.xml");
try {
    ...;
} finally {
    out.close(); // ALWAYS close the resource here!
}
+--+

    Alternatively, you could use a 
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFileWriter.html}<<<TFileWriter>>>}}.

    This is how you could read the entry again:

+--+
InputStream in = new TFileInputStream("file.foo/contents.xml");
try {
    ...;
} finally {
    in.close(); // ALWAYS close the resource here!
}
+--+

    Alternatively, you could use a 
    {{{../apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFileReader.html}<<<TFileReader>>>}}.

    And finally, to delete a virtual directory tree - in this case your custom
    application file - you could use this:

+--+
new TFile("file.foo").rm_r();
+--+

    Note that calling the method <<<rm_r()>>> is required to recursively delete
    the application file because the <<<TFile>>> object refers to a virtual
    directory, which cannot get deleted using similar methods like
    <<<delete()>>> or <<<rm()>>> unless it's empty.
