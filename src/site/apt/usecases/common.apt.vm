    Then you may need to support at least the following archive types:

    * TAR.GZ

    * TAR.BZ2

    * TAR.XZ

    * ZIP

    * JAR

    * WAR

    * EAR

    * ...

    []

    You can easily figure that writing the code to read and write archive
    files of all these types will be a cumbersome and tedious task because
    each archive type typically comes with its own API to read and write
    its archive files.
  #set($tru="true")
  #if($tru.equalsIgnoreCase($writing))
    Furthermore, the algorithms required to manage the state transitions
    required to support arbitrary modifications to an archive file in a
    thread-safe manner are very complex.

    Thanks to the client API of the module
    {{{../truevfs-access/index.html}TrueVFS Access}},
    here's your relief:
    The
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}}
    class extends the <<<java.io.File>>> class in order to add the
    required functionality.
