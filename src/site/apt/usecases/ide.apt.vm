  "Reading and Writing Archive Files")

    See how easy listing the contents of the top level directory of an archive
    file can be:

+--+
TFile[] entries = new TFile("archive.jar").listFiles();
+--+

    To create or overwrite an entry in an archive file, you could simply use
    this:

+--+
try (Writer writer = new TFileWriter("archive.jar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")) {
    ...;
}
+--+

    You may be glad to know that this works recursively, too.
    Here's how to read the manifest of a library JAR within a web
    application:

+--+
try (Reader reader = new TFileReader("app.war/WEB-INF/lib/lib.jar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")) {
    ...;
}
+--+

    And finally, to delete an entry in an archive file, you could use this:

+--+
new TFile("archive.jar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF").rm();
+--+
