Key Features

    [Easy To Use]
        The API of the {{{./truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP File*}} module
        provides convenient read/write access to archive files as if they were
        just plain directories in a file system path.
        Using the classes
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}},
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFileInputStream.html}<<<TFileInputStream>>>}},
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFileOutputStream.html}<<<TFileOutputStream>>>}}
        et al, you can instantly access ZIP files, TAR files and their
        relatives or your own custom archive file format.

    [Fast Bulk I/O]
        The API of the {{{./truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP File*}} module
        provides convenient and powerful methods for fast bulk I/O operations
        like recursive copying, moving or deleting of directory trees and files.
        E.g. using the multi-threaded method
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFile.html#cat(java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream)}<<<TFile.cat(InputStream, OutputStream)>>>}},
        you'll never have to write a naive read-then-write copy loop again.

    [File System Federation]
        TrueZIP supports virtual file system federation.
        This enables an application to access archive files within any other
        virtual file systems, e.g. you could read the contents of a ZIP file
        which is accessed via HTTP(S) instead of reading it from a file.
        Archive files may also be nested, i.e. contained in another archive
        file.

    [Modular Architecture]
        TrueZIP's architecture is split into separate modules for the
        {{{./truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP Kernel}},
        a set of File System Drivers and some user APIs like e.g. the
        {{{./truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP File*}} module.
        Each module is implemented as a JAR.
        To configure the set of file system types which shall be accessible by
        the application, you simply add the desired file system driver JARs
        to the application's run time class path.

    [Pluggable File System Driver Architecture]
        TrueZIP supports any virtual file system type via its pluggable
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsDriver.html}file system driver}}
        architecture.
        TrueZIP ships with file system drivers for the file system schemes
        FILE, HTTP(S), ZIP, TAR and their relatives like JAR, TGZ, TBZ2 etc.

    [Encrypted Archive File Format]
        The {{{./truezip-driver-tzp/index.html}TrueZIP Driver TZP}} module
        provides support for TrueZIP's custom encrypted ZIP.RAES (or TZP for
        short) file format.
        A TZP file is a ZIP file with UTF-8 character set which is wrapped in
        a RAES file envelope.
        RAES is TrueZIP's custom Random Access Encryption Specification which
        supports SHA-256 authentication and AES-256 decryption in CTR block
        mode for transparent, read/write access to its encrypted payload.
        By using CTR mode, RAES supports transparent <random> read access to
        its encrypted payload, which makes reading a TZP pretty fast.

    [ZIP64 Support]
        The {{{./truezip-driver-zip/index.html}TrueZIP Driver ZIP}} module
        provides read/write support for ZIP64 files.
        This is fully transparent, so the application does not have to do
        anything - even when using the class
        {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/zip/ZipOutputStream.html}<<<ZipOutputStream>>>}}
        directly.

    [Thread-Safe]
        Multiple threads can read and write the same archive file at the same
        time.

    [Robust]
        TrueZIP recognizes false positive archive files, so it cannot
        get confused by an arbitrary file which inadvertenly uses a suffix of
        a supported archive file type.
        TrueZIP code uses assertions, JUnit tests and static code analysis
        tools like FindBugs and JDepend in order to achieve its high
        reliability standards.
