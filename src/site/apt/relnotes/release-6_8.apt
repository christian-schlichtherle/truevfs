Release Notes for TrueZIP 6.8

    (September 21st, 2010)
            
    This is a maintenance release \- it fixes classloading for OSGI
    environments, updates the Javadoc and fixes some issues with the unit tests
    for Swing GUI classes.

    Last, but not least, Maven is now used for the build and release process.
    The Maven Coordinates are <<<de.schlichtherle:truezip:jar:6.8>>>.
    You will see the artifacts appear in
    {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/schlichtherle/truezip/}Maven Central}}.

    If and only if you are using TrueZIP to access TAR files or
    derivative archive file types, then you need to upgrade the run
    time dependency <<<ant.jar>>> to Ant 1.8.1 (see below).

    Upgrading is recommended for all users.

    []

* Updates in the Default Package
                
    [[1]] <<Changed:>> Removed the command line utility classes in this
        package. This step is intended to enhance compatibility with OSGi
        environments.

* Updates in the Package <<<de.schlichtherle>>>
                
    [[1]] <<Changed:>> Moved the command line utility classes in this
        package to the package
        <<<de.schlichtherle.io.samples>>>.

    []

* Updates in the Package <<<de.schlichtherle.io>>>
                
    [[1]] <<Fixed:>> Changed the class loading algorithm in the method
        <<<ArchiveDriverRegistry.createArchiveDriver>>>
        so that it should work in both OSGi and JEE environments.
        For more information, please refer to
        {{{https://truezip.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id\=34}issue #34}}.

    [[1]] <<Fixed:>> Changed the resource enumeration algorithm in the method
    <<<GlobalArchiveDriverRegistry.registerArchiveDrivers>>>
    so that it should work in both OSGi and JEE environments.
    For more information, please refer to
    {{{https://truezip.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id\=34}issue #34}}.

* Updates in the Package <<<de.schlichtherle.io.samples>>>
                
    [[1]] <<Changed:>> Moved the command line utility classes from the
        package
        <<<de.schlichtherle>>>
        to this package.

    [[1]] <<Enhanced:>> Internationalized Strings by using a ResourceBundle.

    []

* Updates in the Package <<<de.schlichtherle.io.archive.tar>>>
                
    [[1]] <<Fixed:>> The constructors <<<TarEntry(String)>>> and
        <<<TarEntry(org.apache.tools.tar.TarEntry)>>> in the class
        <<<TarEntry>>> now use the newly introduced constructor
        <<<org.apache.tools.tar.TarEntry(String, boolean)>>> in order
        to work around a regression introduced in Ant 1.8 (see
        {{{https://truezip.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id\=36}issue #36}}).
        As a consequence, in order to access TAR files or derivative archive
        file types, you need to have <<<ant.jar>>> from Ant 1.8.1 in
        your class path.

        <<<BasicZipFile.createReadOnlyFile>>>

        parameter instead.
