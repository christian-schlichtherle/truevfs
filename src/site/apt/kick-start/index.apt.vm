Getting Started

* Using Maven

    TrueVFS is a multi-module project which is built by
    {{{http://maven.apache.org}Apache Maven}}, so all its artifacts are hosted
    on
    {{{http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22de.schlichtherle.truezip%22%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22}Maven Central}}.
    If you are using Maven too, then you you can generate, build and run your
    first TrueVFS application for the two client APIs TrueVFS&#160;File* or
    TrueVFS&#160;Path in about ten minutes by following these guides:

    [[1]] {{{./file/eclipse.html}Getting started with Eclipse}}.

    [[1]] {{{./file/netbeans.html}Getting started with NetBeans}}.

    [[1]] {{{./file/shell.html}Getting started with a shell}}.

    []

    These guides were written with the archetype for the TrueVFS File*
    API in mind.
    However, they work the same way with the archetype for the TrueVFS Path
    API - just pick the Maven archetype coordinates for your preferred client
    API from the following table:

*--+--+--+--+--+
|| Client API || Requires || Archetype Group Id || Archetype Artifact Id || Archetype Version
*--+--+--+--+--+
| {{{../truezip-file/index.html}TrueVFS File*}} | JSE&#160;6 | <<<de.schlichtherle.truezip>>> | <<<truezip-archetype-file>>> | <<<${project.version}>>>
*--+--+--+--+--+
| {{{../truezip-path/index.html}TrueVFS Path}} | JSE&#160;7 | <<<de.schlichtherle.truezip>>> | <<<truezip-archetype-path>>> | <<<${project.version}>>>
*--+--+--+--+--+

* Manual Download

    If you do not want to use Maven then you can easily download the TrueVFS
    artifacts from Maven Central when following this guide:
    {{{./no-maven.html}Getting started without Maven}}.

    If you are looking for more sample code and applications, then please
    {{{../source-repository.html}check out}} or
    {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/schlichtherle/truezip/truezip-samples/${project.version}/truezip-samples-${project.version}-sources.jar}download}}
    the source code of the module
    {{{../truezip-samples/index.html}TrueVFS Samples}}.

* Tutorial (new)

    A short {{{./tutorial.html}tutorial}} is available for the TrueVFS File* API.
    It does not require you to use Maven, but it assumes you have
    already setup an application skeleton.
