Getting Started

* Using Maven

    TrueVFS is a multi-module project which is built by
    {{{http://maven.apache.org}Apache Maven}}, so all its artifacts are hosted
    on
    {{{http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22net.java.truevfs%22%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22}Maven Central}}.

** Using the TrueVFS Archetype Access

    You can generate, build and run your first TrueVFS application from the
    {{{../truevfs-archetype/truevfs-archetype-access/index.html}TrueVFS&#160;Archetype&#160;Access}}
    in about ten minutes by following these guides:

    * {{{./file/eclipse.html}Getting started with Eclipse}}.

    * {{{./file/netbeans.html}Getting started with NetBeans}}.

    * {{{./file/shell.html}Getting started with a Shell}}.

    []

    The generated application contains lots of sample code demonstrating
    different parts of the client API in Java and Scala, so please give it a
    try.

* Manual Download

    If you do not want to use Maven then you can easily download the TrueVFS
    artifacts from Maven Central following this guide:

    * {{{./no-maven.html}Getting started without Maven}}.

    []

* Tutorial

    A short {{{./tutorial.html}tutorial}} is available for the
    TrueVFS&#160;Access API.
    It doesn't require you to use Maven, but it assumes you have
    already setup some application skeleton.

* Sample Code

    If you are looking for sample code and applications, please
    {{{../source-repository.html}check out}} or
    {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/truevfs/truevfs-samples/${project.version}/truevfs-samples-${project.version}-sources.jar}download}}
    the source code of the module
    {{{../truevfs-samples/index.html}TrueVFS Samples}}.
