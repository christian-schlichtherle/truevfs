Getting started with a Shell

    This guide shows how to kick-start a TrueVFS application in a command line
    shell with the help of a Maven archetype.
    If you are using Eclipse, then please read the guide for
    {{{./eclipse.html}Eclipse}}
    instead.
    If you are using NetBeans, then please read the guide for
    {{{./netbeans.html}NetBeans}}
    instead.

* Motivation

    A typical issue for beginners is understanding the dependency of TrueVFS 7
    on
    {{{../../truevfs-driver/index.html}file system driver modules}}
    at run time:
    The module {{{../../truevfs-access/index.html}TrueVFS Access}} uses a
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/kernel/spec/sl/FsDriverMapLocator.html#SINGLETON}file system driver map service locator singleton}}
    which scans the class path for
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/kernel/spec/spi/FsDriverMapModifier.html}file system driver map modifier services}}.
    These file system driver services are contained in
    {{{../../truevfs-driver/index.html}file system driver modules}}.
    By adding the JAR artifacts of the file system driver modules to the run
    time class path of your application, you trigger the module TrueVFS Access
    to add their file system drivers to the
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TConfig.html#get()}current configuration}}
    with its
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TConfig.html#getArchiveDetector()}archive detection}}.

    Although it's straightforward, setting up the class path can be a daunting
    task for TrueVFS beginners, so a Maven archetype is provided as a template
    for TrueVFS applications.
    This archetype shows how to setup the run time dependencies and, as an
    alternative, how to avoid using the service locator by using dependency
    injection instead.

* Prerequisites

    You need to have the following software installed:

    * {{{http://maven.apache.org}Apache&#160;Maven&#160;3.0.3}}

    * JSE&#160;7 for applications using the TrueVFS&#160;Access API.

    []

* Generate Maven Archetype

    To generate the application archetype, type the following command in a
    shell while setting the <<<groupId>>>, <<<artifactId>>> and
    <<<package>>> properties to the appropriate values for your project:

+--
$ mvn archetype:generate -B \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=net.java.truevfs \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=truevfs-archetype-access \
    -DarchetypeVersion=${project.version} \
    -DgroupId=com.company \
    -DartifactId=project \
    -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT \
    -Dpackage=com.company.project
+--

    Upon successful execution, a new directory with the value of the
    <<<artifactId>>> property as its name will have been created in the current
    directory.
    If you copy/paste the above command literally to a shell this would result
    in the following directory structure:

+--
project
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- main
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- company
                    `-- project
                        |-- Application.java
                        |-- Cat.java
                        |-- Copy.java
                        |-- Pickr.java
                        `-- Tree.java
+--

* Explore Your Application

    The project directory contains the following files:

    [<<<pom.xml>>>]
    This is the Maven Project Object Model (POM).
    The POM declares the properties of your project to Maven so that it can
    build, install and run it.
    Within the \<project\>/\<dependencies\> element is the declaration of the
    dependencies of your application, i.e. the JARs required to compile and run
    it.
    Each file system driver module on the run time class path adds to the
    initial set up of detected archive types by the TrueVFS Access File* and TrueVFS
    Path API as explained above, so please edit it
    {{{Edit_Your_Application}later}} to meet your application requirements.
    For now, please leave this file alone.

    [<<<src/main/java/com/company/project/Application.java>>>]
    This abstract base class runs the setup-work-sync life cycle of a typical
    TrueVFS application.
    It overrides the method
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TApplication.html#setup()}<<<TApplication.setup()>>>}}
    in order to customize the initial setup.

    [<<<src/main/java/com/company/project/Cat.java>>>]
    This command line utility recursively copies its file arguments to the 
    standard output in order.
    If you name any archive file entries in the arguments, they get
    copied, too.

    For example, if the JAR for the module <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>> is
    present on the run time class path, you could use the argument
    <<<archive.zip/readme.txt>>> to print the contents of the entry
    <<<readme.txt>>> in the archive file <<<archive.zip>>>.

    [<<<src/main/java/com/company/project/Copy.java>>>]
    This command line utility recursively copies its first file or
    directory argument to its second file or directory argument.
    Instead of a directory, you can name any configured archive file type in
    the path names, too.
    If you name any archive files in the destination path name, they get
    automatically created.

    For example, if the JAR for the module <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>> is
    present on the run time class path and the destination path name is
    <<<archive.zip>>>, a ZIP file with this name gets created unless it
    already exists.

    [<<<src/main/java/com/company/project/Pickr.java>>>]
    This utility is only available with the archetype for the TrueVFS Access File*
    module.
    It llets you pick a file using a
    {{{../../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/swing/TFileChooser.html}<<<TFileChooser>>>}}
    and prints it's path.
    Of course, <<<TFileChooser>>> can browse archive files, too.

    For example, if the JAR for the module <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>> is present
    on the run time class path and a ZIP file <<<archive.zip>>> exists, then
    you can double click it to browse its entries.
    
    [<<<src/main/java/com/company/project/Tree.java>>>]
    This command line utility prints the tree graph of the directory structure
    of its file or directory arguments to the standard output.
    Instead of a directory, you can name any configured archive file type as an
    argument, too.

    For example, if the JAR for the module <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>> is present
    on the run time class path and the path name argument is <<<archive.zip>>>
    and this file actually exists as a ZIP file, then the tree graph of the
    directory structure of this ZIP file gets printed.

* Build And Run Your Application

    To build and install your application in your local Maven repository,
    enter:

+--
$ cd project
$ mvn clean install
+--

    Close to the end of the output of the Maven command, it should read
    <<<[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS>>>:

    To run the main class <<<Tree>>>, enter:

+--
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.company.project.Tree
+--

    This should produce a similar output to the following in the Console view:

+--
.
|-- pom.xml
|-- src
|   `-- main
|       `-- java
|           `-- com
|               `-- company
|                   `-- project
|                       |-- Application.java
|                       |-- Cat.java
|                       |-- Copy.java
|                       |-- Pickr.java
|                       `-- Tree.java
`-- target
    |-- classes
    |   `-- com
    |       `-- company
    |           `-- project
    |               |-- Application.class
    |               |-- Cat.class
    |               |-- Copy.class
    |               |-- Pickr.class
    |               `-- Tree.class
    |-- generated-sources
    |   `-- annotations
    |-- maven-archiver
    |   `-- pom.properties
    |-- project-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    |   |-- META-INF
    |   |   |-- MANIFEST.MF
    |   |   `-- maven
    |   |       `-- com.company
    |   |           `-- project
    |   |               |-- pom.xml
    |   |               `-- pom.properties
    |   `-- com
    |       `-- company
    |           `-- project
    |               |-- Application.class
    |               |-- Cat.class
    |               |-- Copy.class
    |               |-- Pickr.class
    |               `-- Tree.class
    `-- surefire
+--

    Note that the contents of the JAR file
    <<<target/project-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar>>> get listed, too!
    This is because the configuration file <<<pom.xml>>> is set up to recognize
    JAR files as virtual directories by adding the module TrueVFS Driver ZIP
    with the artifactId <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>> to the run time class path.
    You can change this by editing the configuration file <<<pom.xml>>> or 
    the method <<<Application.html.setup()>>>.

* Edit Your Application

    Now you're ready and set to edit your application to meet your requirements.

    Mind that the class <<<Application>>> is just a template to show the
    setup-work-sync life cycle of a typical TrueVFS application:
    You don't need to use this class at all as long as your application
    implements this life cycle somehow.

    Finally, don't forget to configure the run time dependencies in the
    <<<pom.xml>>> unless your application explicitly configures the archive
    detection in its setup phase.
