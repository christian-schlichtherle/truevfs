Tutorial

    TrueVFS provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for archive
    files while maintaining an easy-to-use file system API.
    This enables you to treat archive files as if they were virtual directories
    and archive entries as if they were virtual files within these virtual
    directories.

    The following tutorial assumes some preconditions:

    * You need to have a basic knowledge of the <<<java.io>>> API (Application
      Programming Interface).
      If not, please refer to
      {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/}The Java Tutorials Lesson: Basic I/O}}
      first.

    * You need to have a working application skeleton with the required TrueVFS
      JARs on the class path.
      If not present, please refer to the page
      {{{./index.html#Kick-Starting}Getting Started}}
      first.

    []

* The package <<<net.java.truevfs.access>>>

    The module TrueVFS Access solely consists of the package
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/package-summary.html}<<<net.java.truevfs.access>>>}}.
    This package supports two I/O API styles:

    *
    The old I/O API style (alias OIO, available since Java 1))
    is supported by the classes
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileInputStream.html}<<<TFileInputStream>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileOutputStream.html}<<<TFileOutputStream>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileReader.html}<<<TFileReader>>>}} and
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileWriter.html}<<<TFileWriter>>>}},
    or just <<<TFile*>>> for short.

    *
    The new I/O API style (alias NIO.2, specified in JSR&#160;203 and included
    in JSE&#160;7) is supported by the classes
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TPath.html}<<<TPath>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileSystem.html}<<<TFileSystem>>>}} and
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileSystemProvider.html}<<<TFileSystemProvider>>>}}.

    []

** OIO API style

    Using the OIO API style, your starting point for almost all file system
    operations is the class <<<TFile>>>.
    This class inherits from <<<java.io.File>>>, so you can use it with other
    APIs for its super class.
    The class
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/swing/TFileChooser.html}<<<TFileChooser>>>}}
    in the module
    {{{../truevfs-access-swing/index.html}TrueVFS&#160;Access&#160;Swing}}
    uses this feature by subclassing <<<javax.swing.JFileChooser>>> so that you
    can browse archive files with it, too.
    However, you can't use a plain old <<<java.io.FileInputStream>>>,
    <<<java.io.FileOutputStream>>> et al with a <<<TFile>>> object.
    You have to use a <<TFileInputStream>>, <<TFileOutputStream>> et al instead.

    Although the <<<TFile>>> class extends <<<File>>>, it also provides many
    additional methods to overcome the known limitations of its super class,
    e.g. the additional methods throw an <<<java.io.IOException>>> on failure
    instead of simply returning a boolean value.
    So the OIO API style is by no means obsolete - see below.

** NIO.2 API style

    If you prefer the NIO.2 API style, then your starting point is the class
    <<<TPath>>>.
    The NIO.2 API overcomes many constraints of the OIO API.
    However, for the brevity of this tutorial, the NIO.2 API is not covered
    here.
    For more information, please refer to the documentation of the module
    {{{../truevfs-access/index.html}TrueVFS&#160;Access}}.

* Create

    Creating an archive file works exactly like creating any other directory,
    so you could simply call
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#mkdir()}<<<TFile.mkdir()>>>}}
    or
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#mkdirs()}<<<TFile.mkdirs()>>>}}
    in order to create an archive file or a member directory.

+--+
File dir = new TFile("archive.zip/dir");
dir.mkdirs(); // don't do this!
+--+

    However, while this works as expected, it's actually sub-optimal:
    Explicitly creating a directory within an archive file may create an
    otherwise empty archive entry for the directory in the target archive file.
    This wastes space in the resulting archive file and therefore is not
    recommended.
    Instead, you should simply directly create the file entries within an
    archive file.

    The following example shows how to create an archive entry with the class
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileWriter.html}<<<TFileWriter>>>}}
    without the need to create its containing archive file or the directory
    within this archive file first:

+--+
File entry = new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt");
Writer writer = new TFileWriter(entry);
try {
    writer.write("Hello world!\n");
} finally {
    writer.close();
}
+--+

    Note the use of a finally-block to ensure that the writer gets always
    <<<close()>>>d.
    This is vital for any I/O resource (not just within TrueVFS) in order to
    ensure that any operating system resources get released as soon as possible,
    even in the event of an <<<IOException>>> or any other <<<Throwable>>>, e.g.
    an <<<OutOfMemoryError>>>.
    Please also consider that the <<<close()>>> method may throw an
    <<<IOException>>>, too.
    <<It is an error to ignore this!>>
    So please wrap the entire block in another try-catch block or else declare
    the enclosing method to potentially throw an <<<IOException>>>.

    Actually, it's a typical issue for long running Java applications to run
    out of file descriptors because the programmers haven't ensured to properly
    close their I/O resources.
    So please make sure you always close your I/O resources in a finally-block.
    In case you need some aid to check your code for this issue, I recommend to
    use {{{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net}FindBugs}}.

* Read

    Reading an archive entry is as easy as writing it - just use a class like
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFileReader.html}<<<TFileReader>>>}}
    and point it to the archive entry:

+--+
File entry = new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt");
Reader reader = new TFileReader(entry);
try {
    // Do the processing here
    ...
} finally {
    reader.close();
}
+--+

    Note again the use of a finally-block to ensure that the reader gets always
    <<<close()>>>d.

    OK, this is trivial, but how do you find the archive entry to read in the
    first place?
    Remember that the <<<TFile>>> class extends <<<File>>>, so you can simply
    use
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#list()}<<<TFile.list()>>>}},
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#listFiles()}<<<TFile.listFiles()>>>}}
    etc.

    The following example prints the members of the previously created archive
    file to the standard output:

+--+
TFile archive = new TFile("archive.zip");
for (String member : archive.list())
  System.out.println(member);
+--+

    Following the previous example, this would just print the string <<<dir>>>
    to the standard output.
    This is because <<<File.list()>>>, and hence <<<TFile.list()>>>, just list
    the immediate members of a (virtual) directory.
    You need to apply this method recursively to print an entire directory tree.

* Update

    Overwriting the contents of an archive entry works in exactly the same way
    like creating it - just use a <<<TFileOutputStream>>> or a <<<TFileWriter>>>
    and point it to the respective archive entry with the help of a <<<TFile>>>.

    Of course a file system does not only store entry contents, but also some
    meta data, e.g. the last modification time.
    Just like with a real file system, you can easily update the last
    modification time of an archive entry by calling
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#setLastModified(long)}<<<TFile.setLastModified(long)>>>}}.

+--+
File entry = new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt");
entry.setLastModified(System.currentTimeMillis()); // sub-optimal!
+--+

    However, there may be smarter ways to do this:
    Most times you want to set the last modification of a file system entry its
    because you are copying one file system entry to another and you want to
    preserve some meta data, too.
    In this case you should use the {{Bulk I/O Methods}} instead in order to
    benefit from their superior performance.

* Delete

    You may be guessing it already, so let it suffice to say that deleting an
    archive entry works in exactly the same way as with a regular file system
    entry - just call
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#delete()}<<<TFile.delete()>>>}}.

+--+
File entry = new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt");
boolean ok = entry.delete(); // sub-optimal!
+--+

    One shortcoming of this method is that it just returns a boolean value to
    indicate success or failure.
    To overcome this, another method has been added which is aptly named
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#rm()}<<<TFile.rm()>>>}}.

+--+
new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt").rm();
+--+

    This method returns <<<this>>> for fluent programming and throws an
    <<<IOException>>> with the path name and a short description of what went
    wrong as its message.

* Bulk I/O Methods

    TrueVFS is not just about accessing archive files:
    The <<<TFile>>> class provides some very useful methods for standard tasks
    like copying, moving or removing entire directory trees.
    Here's how to create a TAR.GZ file from a ZIP file:

+--+
new TFile("archive.zip").cp_rp(new TFile("archive.tar.gz"));
+--+

    These methods are not only very convenient to use, they also provide
    superior performance because they apply multithreading and in the case of
    archive entries, use a feature called Raw Data Copying (RDC).
    For example when copying arbitrary file system entries, one thread reads
    the input entry while another thread writes the output entry.
    When copying ZIP entries from one ZIP file to another, then thanks to RDC
    the input entry does <not> get decompressed just in order to compress it
    again to the output entry;
    instead, the raw entry data gets copied from the input entry to the output
    entry directly.

    For more information about the available bulk I/O methods, please refer to
    the section
    {{{../apidocs/net/java/truevfs/access/TFile.html#bulkIOMethods}Bulk I/O methods}}
    of the <<<TFile>>> class Javadoc.
    For now, let's just clean up behind us:

+--+
new TFile("archive.zip").rm_r();    // remove recursively
new TFile("archive.tar.gz").rm_r(); // dito
+--+

#configuration("<<<tar.gz>>> or <<<zip>>>",
  "TAR.GZ or ZIP",
  "modules
   {{{../truevfs-driver/truevfs-driver-tar/index.html}TrueVFS Driver TAR}}
   and
   {{{../truevfs-driver/truevfs-driver-zip/index.html}TrueVFS Driver ZIP}}
   need",
  "<<<truevfs-driver-tar>>> and <<<truevfs-driver-zip>>>")
