Getting started without Maven

    If you do not want to use Maven then you can easily
    {{{http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22de.schlichtherle.truevfs%22%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22}<<download individual TrueVFS artifacts>>}}
    from Maven Central.
    You can also directly {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/java/truevfs/truevfs-samples/${project.version}/truevfs-samples-${project.version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar}<<download the all-in-one JAR>>}}.

    The all-in-one JAR saves you from grabbing the module JARs individually.
    However, as the name implies, it includes all sample code which bloats the
    code size of the application.
    More importantly, this will also initially set up the TrueVFS&#160;Access
    API to detect <all> canonical file extensions of <all> supported archive
    file types in TrueVFS&#160;${project.version}.
   Â Because the virtual file system of an archive file gets automatically
    mounted upon first access, this may produce some unwanted side effects:

    * All archive files will behave like virtual directories instead of
      regular files.
      This may confuse the application if not needed.

    * In case of TAR files, the driver will unpack the entire TAR file into a
      temporary directory first because the TAR file format doesn't provide a
      central directory for fast random access.
      This may seriously degrade performance if not needed, however.

    * In case of an EXE file, the driver will attempt to locate the central
      directory of a self extracting ZIP file which will cause the entire
      file to be read if its actually a plain EXE file.
      Again, this may seriously degrade performance if not needed.

    * In case of a ZIP.RAES file, a Swing or console based dialog will prompt
      the user for a password to access its encrypted contents.
      This may confuse the user if not needed.

    []

    To avoid these unwanted side effects, you should <always> configure the
    TrueVFS&#160;Access API to detect exactly only the file suffixes of the
    archive types required to access.
    You can simply do so by adding only the required driver modules to run time
    class path or apply the following {{{../usecases/aff.html}sample}} for
    explicit configuration.
