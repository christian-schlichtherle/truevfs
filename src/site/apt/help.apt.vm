    The documentation on this site is generally split across modules,
    so please check the section <Sub-Modules> in the navigation bar on the
    left side.
    If you need help with the APIs, please check the comprehensive
    {{{./apidocs/index.html}<<Javadoc>>}}.
    This is updated for every release, so it may be worth to recheck if have
    you been missing something in the past.

    Please also check the {{{./faq.html}<<Frequently Asked Questions>>}}.

    OnceÂ your question or issue is regarded as a bug report, improvement
    request, feature request or task request it gets tracked in
    {{{http://java.net/jira/browse/TRUEVFS}<<JIRA>>}}.
    You can then use JIRA to monitor and discuss its progress, vote for it, add
    file attachments, download hotfixes etc.
    JIRA is also used to schedule new TrueVFS versions and prepare their
    Release Notes.
