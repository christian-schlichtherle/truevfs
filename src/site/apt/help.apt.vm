Getting Help

    The documentation on this site is generally split across modules,
    so please check the section <Sub-Modules> in the navigation bar on the
    left of this page.
    If you need help with the client APIs, please check the comprehensive
    {{{../apidocs/index.html}<<Javadoc>>}}.
    This is updated for every release, so it may be worth to recheck if have
    you been missing something in the past.

    Please also check the {{{../faq.html}<<Frequently Asked Questions>>}}.

    For any bug report, improvement request, feature request, task request,
    help request etc. please subscribe to the
    {{{../mail-lists.html}<<User Mailing List>>}} and post it there.
    If you have an account on {{{http://java.net}java.net}}, your subscription
    will get immediately accepted, otherwise you'll have to wait until it gets
    manually accepted.
    The response time for approving subscription requests and answering posts
    is usually less than a day - this goes without warranties!

    OnceÂ your question or issue has been regarded as a bug report, improvement
    request, feature request or task request it gets tracked in
    {{{http://java.net/jira/browse/TRUEZIP}<<JIRA>>}}.
    You can then use JIRA to monitor and discuss its progress, vote for it, add
    file attachments, download hotfixes etc.
    JIRA is also used to schedule new TrueZIP versions and prepare their
    Release Notes.

    Finally, if you want to stay up to date please check
