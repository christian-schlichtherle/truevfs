Abstract

    This article shows the usage of the API of the TrueZIP Kernel module.

TrueZIP Kernel versus TrueZIP File*

    The API of the TrueZIP Kernel module is considerably different to the API
    of the TrueZIP File* module:
    While the File* API primarily aims to "make simple things easy",
    the Kernel API primarily aims to "make complex things possible".

    This means that while the Kernel API offers more features than the File*
    API, it also requires more coding to get a job done.
    So when is it appropriate to code against the Kernel API instead of the
    File* API?

    * If you don't want to rely on the service locator pattern which is
        employed by the File* API in order to enumerate the set of file
        system drivers which are available on the class path at run-time.

    * If the type of the top level file system your application needs to
        access is not an OS file system (adressed by the "file" scheme),
        but any other file system type, e.g. a web service
        (adressed by the "http" scheme).

    * If you need to access file system specific entry properties,
        e.g. the property
        {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/zip/ZipEntry.html#getComment()}<<<comment>>>}}
        of the class
        {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/zip/ZipEntry.html}<<<ZipEntry>>>}}
        in a ZIP file.

    * If you want to reduce the number of kernel calls required to query
        a set of properties for the same file system entry.

Basic Operations

    Suppose you'ld like to imitate the functionality of the <<<cat(1)>>> Unix
    command line utility.
    This utility simply concatenates the contents of each parameter path name
    on the standard output.
    E.g. the shell command...

+--
$ cat fileA fileB
+--

    ...would print the contents of <<<fileA>>> and then <<<fileB>>> to standard
    output.

    Here's how to copy the contents of the path name parameter <<<resource>>>
    to the standard output using the API of the module TrueZIP File*:

%{snippet|id=cat|file=src/main/java/de/schlichtherle/truezip/sample/file/app/PathCat.java}

    Suppose that the modules TrueZIP Driver ZIP
    (Maven artifactId <<<truezip-driver-zip>>>) and TrueZIP Driver File
    (<<<truezip-driver-file>>>) are present on the class path at run-time.
    Furthermore, if the current directory is the root directory and the file
    <<<file>>> exists and the file <<<archive.zip>>> is a valid ZIP file,
    then the following path names could be addressed with the code above:

    * <<<file>>>

    * <<</file>>>

    * <<<archive.zip/entry>>>

    * <<</archive.zip/entry>>>

    []

    Basically any valid path name could be addressed with this code.
    If an application needs to address URIs, too, then the following code
    could be used instead:

%{snippet|id=cat|file=src/main/java/de/schlichtherle/truezip/sample/file/app/UriCat.java}

    Using the same configuration like before, the following URIs could now be
    addressed with the code above:

    * <<<file>>>

    * <<</file>>>

    * <<<file:/file>>>

    * <<<archive.zip/entry>>>

    * <<</archive.zip/entry>>>

    * <<<zip:file:/archive.zip!/entry>>>

    []

    This adds a lot of flexibility, but the File* API still has one limitation:
    All URIs must be file-based, i.e. the scheme of their top level file system
    must be <<<file>>>.
    In particular, it's not possible to access a resource via HTTP(S).

    Now for comparison, let's implement the same functionality using the API
    of the module TrueZIP Kernel.

%{snippet|id=cat|file=src/main/java/de/schlichtherle/truezip/sample/kernel/app/Cat.java}

    Using the same configuration like before, this code could access the same
    URIs than before.
    However, this could access <any> URI scheme for which a file system driver
    is present on the class path at run-time, too.
    E.g. if the module TrueZIP Driver HTTP(S) (<<<truezip-driver-http>>>) is
    present on the class path at run-time, even http(s)-based URIs could get
    accessed.

    Just for fun, try the code above with the following URI:

---
zip:zip:zip:zip:zip:zip:zip:http://truezip.java.net/truezip-samples/test/1.zip!/0.zip!/this.zip!/is.zip!/nuts.zip!/or.zip!/not.zip!/x
---

    And for even more fun, try the code above with the following URI and
    provide the top secret password <<<test1234>>> when prompted:

---
zip:zip:zip:zip:tzp:zip:zip:http://truezip.java.net/truezip-samples/test/1.zip!/0.zip!/test1234.tzp!/is.zip!/nuts.zip!/or.zip!/not.zip!/x
---

    To be continued...
