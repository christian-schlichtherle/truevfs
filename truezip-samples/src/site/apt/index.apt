About TrueZIP Samples

    Sample applications to demonstrate the usage of various TrueZIP module
    APIs.

    Some of these samples use rather advanced or exotic features which
    makes them more complex than necessary for a typical application.

    By design, the sample applications use all file system drivers which
    can be located at run time.
    Location of the available file system drivers is performed by
    scanning the class path - see the Javadoc for the TrueZIP Kernel class
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/sl/FsDriverLocator.html}<<<FsDriverLocator>>>}}
    for more information.
