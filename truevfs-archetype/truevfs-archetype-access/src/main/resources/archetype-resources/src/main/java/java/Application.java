     * in order to answer the following questions:
     * <ul>
     * <li>What are the file extensions which shall get recognized as archive
     *     files and hence as virtual directories?
     * <li>Shall missing archive files and directory entries get automatically
     *     created whenever required?
     * </ul>

     * the type of the feedback when prompting the user for keys for RAES
     * encrypted ZIP alias ZIP.RAES alias TZP files by the Swing based
     * prompting key manager.
     * If this JVM is running in headless mode, then this configuration is
     * ignored and the user is prompted by the console I/O based prompting
     * key manager.
