Configuring TrueVFS Access

    TrueVFS follows the convention-over-configuration principle as much as
    possible,
    so there are reasonable defaults for everything in order to relieve you
    from typical configuration tasks.

    For example, in order to configure the detectable archive file extensions,
    you just need to make sure that the JAR artifacts of the respective file
    system driver modules are present on the class path.
    At run time, the module
    {{{../truevfs-kernel/index.html}TrueVFS Kernel}}
    will then enumerate the available file system drivers in order to register
    their canonical archive file extensions and make this mapping available for
    the initial setup of the client API module {{{./index.html}TrueVFS Access}}.
    To see the list of canonical archive file extensions, please consult the
    documentation of the respective file system driver module, e.g.
    {{{../truevfs-driver/truevfs-driver-zip/index.html}TrueVFS Driver ZIP}}.

    If you use Maven, you just need to add the driver modules as dependencies
    to your POM like this:

+--+
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.java.truevfs</groupId>
      <artifactId>truevfs-driver-zip</artifactId>
      <version>$project.version</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
+--+

    However, if you want to change any of these defaults, then you may need
    some more insight which is given in this article.

* The class <<<TArchiveDetector>>>

    The task of the class
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html}<<<TArchiveDetector>>>}}
    is to scan path names for archive file extensions and map it to the
    respective
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/kernel/FsArchiveDriver.html}<<<FsArchiveDriver>>>}}
    class.
    For example, it could detect the file extension <<<jar>>> in the path name
    <<<directory/lib.jar>>> and map it to the class
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/driver/zip/JarDriver.html}<<<JarDriver>>>}}.

    <<<TArchiveDetector>>> provides many options for archive detection:

    * The predefined object 
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#NULL}<<<TArchiveDetector.NULL>>>}}
    detects no archive file extensions at all.

    * The predefined object 
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#ALL}<<<TArchiveDetector.ALL>>>}}
    detects all archive file extensions which have been registered
    in the module {{{./truevfs-kernel/index.html}TrueVFS Kernel}}
    by enumerating the file system drivers on the class path.
    Please consult the documentation of the individual driver modules for the
    list of registered archive file extensions.

    * The constructor 
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#TArchiveDetector(java.lang.String)}<<<TArchiveDetector(String extensions)>>>}}
    lets you filter the list of archive file extensions known by
    <<<TArchiveDetector.ALL>>>.
    This enables you to limit the set of all archive file extensions registered
    by all file system driver modules on the run time class path.

    * The constructor
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#TArchiveDetector(java.lang.String, net.truevfs.kernel.FsDriver)}<<<TArchiveDetector(String extensions, FsDriver driver)>>>}}
    lets you define a custom list of archive file extension for any archive
    driver.
    This enables you to define a custom {{{./usecases/aff.html}application file format}}.

    []

    Please consult the
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html}Javadoc}}
    for even more constructor options.

    The following example would map the file extensions <<<foo>>> and <<<bar>>>
    to the archive driver for JAR files in order to define a custom application
    file format.

+--+
TArchiveDetector ad = new TArchiveDetector(
    "foo|bar", new JarDriver(IOPoolLocator.SINGLETON));
+--+

* The class <<<TFile>>>

    Whenever an object of the class
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}}
    is constructed, a <<<TArchiveDetector>>> is used to scan its path name for
    prospective archive files.
    Because the <<<TFile>>> class is immutable, once an object is created you
    cannot change its archive detector and hence its behavior.

    The <<<TFile>>> class provides multiple overloaded constructors and
    constructing methods, e.g.
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TFile.html#listFiles()}<<<TFile.listFiles()>>>}}.
    Almost all of these come in pairs:
    One variant with and one variant without an additional
    <<<TArchiveDetector>>> parameter.

    If you don't provide a <<<TArchiveDetector>>> parameter to a <<<TFile>>>
    constructor or constructing method, then the class property called
    <default archive detector> is used.
    This class property is initially set to
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#ALL}<<<TArchiveDetector.ALL>>>}},
    which is why the following simple code for the standard use case of
    extracting a ZIP file to a directory works as expected if the JAR of the
    module TrueVFS Driver ZIP is present on the class path:

+--+
// Use default archive detector, which is initially TArchiveDetector.ALL.
TFile src = new TFile("archive.zip"); // needs TrueVFS Driver ZIP on class path.
TFile dst = new TFile("directory");
src.cp_rp(dst); // copy "archive.zip" as a virtual directory!
+--+

    To get or set the default archive detector, call
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#getArchiveDetector}<<<TConfig.get().getArchiveDetector()>>>}}
    or
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#setArchiveDetector(net.truevfs.file.TArchiveDetector)}<<<TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(detector)>>>}}
    respectively - see {{{The class TConfig}below}}.

    Mind that a change of the default archive detector affects only
    subsequently constructed <<<TFile>>> objects.
    Consider the following example:

+--+
// MIND THAT THIS IS NOT THREAD-SAFE!!!
TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL);
...
// Use default archive detector, which is now TArchiveDetector.NULL.
TFile src = new TFile("archive.zip");
TFile dst = new TFile("file");
src.cp_rp(dst); // copy "archive.zip" as a plain old file!
+--+

    Here,
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TArchiveDetector.html#NULL}<<<TArchiveDetector.NULL>>>}}
    is used to disable archive detection and copy <<<archive.zip>>> as a plain
    old file.

    However, there is one problem with this code:
    Because the default archive detector is a class property, the code is not
    thread-safe!
    If the current thread is running the try-block and another thread is
    concurrently constructing <<<TFile>>> objects, then the change of the
    default archive detector would affect these objects.
    To fix this issue, you should avoid changing the default archive detector
    once your application has been initially configured and instead use the
    <<<TConfig>>> class (see below) or use dependency injection like this:

+--+
TFile src = new TFile("archive.zip", TArchiveDetector.NULL);
TFile dst = new TFile("file", TArchiveDetector.NULL);
src.cp_rp(dst); // copy "archive.zip" as a plain old file!
+--+

    Here, the injection of <<<TArchiveDetector.NULL>>> inhibits the detection
    of file <<<archive.zip>>> as a prospective ZIP file, so it gets treated as
    a plain old file.
    For completeness, note that injecting <<<TArchiveDetector.NULL>>> into the
    <<<dst>>> object seems pointless in this example, because <<<file>>> does
    not name a extension at all.
    However, this is not generally true and so the injection prevents the
    creation of a destination ZIP file.

* The class <<<TConfig>>>

    With the advent of TrueVFS 7.2, some more options were necessary to control
    new features.
    However, injecting them as parameters to each method call would mess up the
    API and break binary compatibility to applications of older versions.
    Furthermore, changing options should be thread safe.

    The solution to these requirements is the class
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html}<<<TConfig>>>}}.
    Each instance of this class is a container for configuration options with
    either <global> or <inheritable thread local> scope.
    This may sound scary, but it's really simple to use, so let's look at the
    following example:

+--+
// Push a new current configuration onto the inheritable thread local stack.
TConfig config = TConfig.push();
try {
    // Change the default archive detector and use it subsequently.
    config.setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL);
    //TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL); // equivalent
    TFile src = new TFile("archive.zip");
    TFile dst = new TFile("file");
    src.cp_rp(dst); // copy "archive.zip" as a plain old file!
} finally {
    // Pop the current configuration off the inheritable thread local stack,
    // thereby reverting to the old default archive detector.
    config.close();
}
+--+

    Note the call to
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#close()}<<<TConfig.close()>>>}}
    in the finally-block:
    With JSE7, you could use the try-with-resources statement instead to
    shorten the code to this:

+--+
// Push a new current configuration onto the inheritable thread local stack.
try (TConfig config = TConfig.push()) {
    // Change the default archive detector and use it subsequently.
    config.setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL);
    //TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector.NULL); // equivalent
    TFile src = new TFile("archive.zip");
    TFile dst = new TFile("file");
    src.cp_rp(dst); // copy "archive.zip" as a plain old file!
} // config is automatically closed here
+--+

    To understand why these examples are thread-safe, you first need to know
    that a call to
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#get()}<<<TConfig.get()>>>}}
    returns the <current configuration>, which may be global or inheritable
    thread local.
    So
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#getArchiveDetector()}<<<TConfig.get().getArchiveDetector()>>>}}
    returns the archive detector of the current configuration.
    Similarly,
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#setArchiveDetector(net.truevfs.file.TArchiveDetector)}<<<TConfig.get().setArchiveDetector(TArchiveDetector detector)>>>}}
    updates the archive detector of the current configuration.

    Second, the call to
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TConfig.html#push()}<<<TConfig.push()>>>}}
    copies the current configuration, pushes the copy onto an inheritable
    thread local stack, thereby installing it as the new current configuration,
    and finally returns it.
    Because <<<config>>> is now the current configuration, the subsequent
    change of its archive detector affects the construction of <<<src>>> and
    <<<dst>>> so that archive detection is effectively disabled.

    Finally, because the current configuration is now inheritable thread local,
    this code is thread-safe.
    The attribute <inheritable> in this context means that when a new thread is
    started, it inherits the current configuration of its parent thread.
    However, only the current configuration is inherited, not the entire stack.
    This implies that the new thread could pop at most one current
    configuration off the inheritable thread local stack.

    What would be the current configuration returned by <<<TConfig.get()>>> if
    there had been no previous call to <<<TConfig.push()>>>?
    In this case, the current configuration would be the <global configuration>
    which, as the name implies, is shared by all threads.
    This configuration should get accessed only during application startup to
    configure those aspects of TrueVFS which shall affect the entire
    application.

* The class <<<TApplication>>>

    The class
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TApplication.html}<<<TApplication>>>}}
    is a simple template class which aids you in implementing the typical
    lifecycle of a TrueVFS application.
    Consider the following example:

+--+
class MyApplication extends TApplication<IOException> {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        System.exit(new MyApplication().run(args));
    }

    @Override
    protected void setup() {
        // This should obtain the global configuration.
        TConfig config = TConfig.get();
        // Configure custom application file format.
        config.setArchiveDetector(new TArchiveDetector("aff",
                new JarDriver(IOPoolLocator.SINGLETON)));
        // Set FsOutputOption.GROW for appending-to rather than reassembling
        // existing archive files.
        config.setOutputPreferences(
                config.getOutputPreferences.set(FsOutputOption.GROW));
    }

    ...
}
+--+

    Here, the current configuration is not only used to change the archive
    detector, but also to set FsOutputOption.GROW.
    By overriding
    {{{./apidocs/net/truevfs/file/TApplication.html#setup()}<<<TApplication.setup()>>>}},
    it can be safely assumed that there is no enclosing
    <<<TConfig.push|close()>>> and hence <<<config>>> is indeed the global
    configuration.
