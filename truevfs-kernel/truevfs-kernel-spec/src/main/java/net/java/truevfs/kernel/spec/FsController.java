/**
 * Provides read/write access to a file system.
 *
 * <h3>General Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@link FsModel#getMountPoint() mount point} of the
 * {@linkplain #getModel() file system model}
 * addresses the file system accessed by this controller.
 * Where the methods of this abstract class accept a
 * {@link FsNodeName file system node name} as a parameter, this MUST get
 * resolved against the {@link FsModel#getMountPoint() mount point} URI of this
 * controller's file system model.
  * <p>
 * As of TrueVFS 0.10, application level transactions are not supported,
 * that is, multiple file system operations cannot get composed into a single
 * application level transaction - support for this feature may be added in a
 * future version.
 * <p>
 * However, individual file system operations do come with assertions about
 * their atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.
 * Each method of this interface which is expected to access the file system
 * (rather than just memory) is annotated with an {@link FsAssertion}.
 * The annotation is {@link Inherited}, so the assertion forms part of the
 * contract which any implementation of this interface should comply to.
 * <p>
 * Note that file system controllers are generally allowed to buffer any
 * changes made to their file system.
 * This is generally true for file system controllers which operate on archive
 * files.
 * This means that all changes made to the file system via this interface may
 * not be entirely durable until they get committed by calling {@link #sync}.
 * The annotations account for this stipulation by leaving the
 * {@link FsAssertion#durable() durability} property undefined.
 * <p>
 * An implementation which wants to buffer its changes until {@code sync} gets
 * called needs to notify the {@linkplain FsManager file system manager} by
 * calling {@link FsModel#setMounted setMounted(true)} on the controller's
 * file system model before the first change is commenced.
 * Likewise, when {@code sync} gets called, the controller needs to notify the
 * file system manager by calling {@code setMounted(false)} on the controller's
 * file system model if and only if the {@code sync} has been successfully
 * completed.
 * This protocol enables proper management of the controller's life cycle.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should be thread-safe.
 *

 * @see    FsModel
