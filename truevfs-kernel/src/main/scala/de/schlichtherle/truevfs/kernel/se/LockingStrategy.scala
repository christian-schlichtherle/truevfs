/**
 * Implements a locking strategy with enumerable options to control dead lock
 * prevention.
 * Note that in order to make this class work as designed, you MUST call
 * {@link #apply} for <em>each and every</em> lock which may participate in a
 * dead lock - even if you only want to call {@link Lock#lock()}!
 * Otherwise, the lock accounting in this class will not work!
 * <p>
 * This class does not use timed waiting, so there's no point in feeding it
 * with fair locks.

   * Holds the given lock while calling the given operation.
   * <p>
   * If this is the first execution of this method on the call stack of the
   * current thread, then the lock gets acquired using {@link Lock#lock()}.
   * Once the lock has been acquired the operation gets called.
   * If the operation fails with a {@link NeedsLockRetryException}, then
   * the lock gets temporarily released and the current thread gets paused
   * for a small random amount of milliseconds before this algorithm starts
   * over again.
   * <p>
   * If this is <em>not</em> the first execution of this method on the call
   * stack of the current thread however, then the lock gets acquired
   * according to the strategy defined by this object.
   * If acquiring the lock fails, then a {@code NeedsLockRetryException} gets
   * thrown.
   * Once the lock has been acquired the operation gets called just as if
   * this was the first execution of this method on the call stack of the
   * current thread.
   * <p>
   * If this method is called recursively on the {@link #FAST_LOCK} strategy,
   * then dead locks get effectively prevented by temporarily unwinding the
   * stack and releasing all locks for a small random amount of milliseconds.
   * However, this requires some cooperation by the caller AND the given
   * operation: Both MUST terminate their execution in a consistent state,
   * even if a {@link NeedsLockRetryException} occurs!
   * 
   * @param  <V> the return type of the operation.
   * @param  <X> the exception type of the operation.
   * @param  lock The lock to hold while calling the operation.
   * @param  operation The operation to protect by the lock.
   * @return The result of the operation.
   * @throws X As thrown by the operation.
   * @throws NeedsLockRetryException See above.
