        <p>This module provides convenient multi-threaded read/write access to
            archive files as if they were just plain old directories in a file
            system path by means of the <code>TFile</code>* classes and their
            dependent classes.</p>
        <p>These were the well-known <code>File</code>* classes in
            TrueZIP&nbsp;6 which have now been renamed to <code>TFile</code>*
            and relocated to the new package
            {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.file}.</p>
        <p>This module also provides Swing GUI classes for viewing file trees,
            choosing entries in archive files or path name autocompletion in
            combo boxes.</p>
