            This API provides uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
            directories in a file system path by means of the
            <code>TFile*</code> classes and their dependent classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This API also provides Swing GUI classes for viewing file trees
            and choosing entries in archive files.
