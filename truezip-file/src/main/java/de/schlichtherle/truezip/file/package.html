            Provides uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
            directories in a file system path by means of the
            <code>TFile*</code> classes and their dependent classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the primary API for JSE&nbsp;6 compliant TrueZIP applications:
            In contrast to the TrueZIP Kernel API, this API is designed to be
            easy to learn and convenient to use while providing a great level
            of flexibility.
            However, due to its file-based URI addressing scheme, it can only
            access the platform file system and any archive files within the
            platform file system.
            If you need to access other (virtual) file systems, e.g. HTTP(S),
            then please consider using the TrueZIP Path API or the TrueZIP
            Kernel API instead.
