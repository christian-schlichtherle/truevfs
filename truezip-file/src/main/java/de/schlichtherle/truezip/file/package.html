            Provides uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
            directories in a file system path by means of the
            <code>TFile*</code> classes and their dependent classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the primary API for JSE&nbsp;6 compliant TrueZIP applications:
            Like the TrueZIP Path API, this API is a facade for the TrueZIP
            Kernel API.
            In contrast to the TrueZIP Path API however, this API is limited to
            access the platform file system and any archive files within the
            platform file system.
            In contrast to the TrueZIP Kernel API, both APIs are designed to be
            easy to learn and convenient to use while providing a great level
            of flexibility.
            Because all virtual file system state is managed by the TrueZIP
            Kernel module, this module can concurrently access the same file
            systems than the TrueZIP Path module.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
            file using a {@code TFile} like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    File file = new TFile("archive.tar.gz/README.TXT");
    InputStream in = new TFileInputStream(file);
    try {
        // Read the file contents here.
        ...
    } finally {
        in.close();
    }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            This example requires that the JARs of the file system driver
            modules TrueZIP Driver File and TrueZIP Driver TAR are present
            on the run time class path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this API can only access the platform file system and any
            archive files within the platform file system.
            If you need to access other (virtual) file systems, e.g. HTTP(S),
            then please consider using the TrueZIP Path API or the TrueZIP
            Kernel API instead.
        </p>
