            Provides uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
            read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
            directories in a file system path by means of the
            <code>TFile*</code> classes and their dependent classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the primary API for JSE&nbsp;6 compliant TrueZIP applications:
            Like the API of the module TrueZIP Path, this API is a facade for
            the module TrueZIP Kernel.
            In contrast to the TrueZIP Path API however, this API is limited
            to access the platform file system and any archive files within
            the platform file system.
            In contrast to the TrueZIP Kernel API, both APIs are designed to be
            easy to learn and convenient to use while providing a great level
            of flexibility.
            Because all virtual file system state is managed by the TrueZIP
            Kernel module, this module can concurrently access the same file
            systems than the TrueZIP Path module.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
            file using a {@code TFile} like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    File file = new TFile("archive.tar.gz/README.TXT");
    Writer out = new TFileWriter(file);
    try {
        // Write archive entry contents here.
        ...
    } finally {
        out.close();
    }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            This example presumes that the JARs of the file system driver
            modules TrueZIP Driver File and TrueZIP Driver TAR are present
            on the run time class path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mind that a <code>TFile</code> is a <code>File</code>, so you can
            use it polymorphically.
            However, you cannot use it with a plain
            <code>File(In|Out)putStream</code> or a plain
            <code>File(Reader|Writer)</code> to access prospective archive
            entries because these classes were not designed for this task.
            You have to use a <code>TFile(In|Out)putStream</code> or a
            <code>TFile(Reader|Writer)</code> instead.
