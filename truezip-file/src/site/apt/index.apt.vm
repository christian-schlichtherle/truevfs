About

    This module provides the <<<TFile*>>> classes
    for uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
    read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
    directories in a file system path.

    This is the primary API for JSE&#160;6 compliant TrueZIP applications:
    Like the API of the module {{{../truezip-path/index.html}TrueZIP Path}},
    this API is a facade for the module
    {{{../truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP Kernel}}.
    In contrast to the TrueZIP Path API however, this API is limited
    to access the platform file system and any archive files within
    the platform file system.
    In contrast to the TrueZIP Kernel API, both APIs are designed to be
    easy to learn and convenient to use while providing a great level
    of flexibility.
    Because all virtual file system state is managed by the TrueZIP
    Kernel module, this module can concurrently access the same file
    systems than the TrueZIP Path module.

    For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
    file using a
    {{{./apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}}
    like this:

+--+
File file = new TFile("archive.tar.gz/README.TXT");
OutputStream Out = new TFileOutputStream(file);
try {
    // Write archive entry contents here.
    ...
} finally {
    out.close();
}
+--+

    This example presumes that the JARs of the file system driver modules
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-file/index.html}TrueZIP Driver FILE}}
    and
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-tar/index.html}TrueZIP Driver TAR}}
    are present on the run time class path.

    For more examples, please use the Maven archetype for TrueZIP File* module
    applications as described in the
    {{{../kick-start/index.html}Kick-Starting TrueZIP}} section.

* Swing GUI

    This module also provides Swing GUI classes for viewing file trees
    and choosing entries in archive files.
