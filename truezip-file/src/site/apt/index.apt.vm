About

    This module provides the <<<TFile*>>> classes
    for uniform, transparent, thread-safe,
    read/write access to archive files as if they were just plain
    directories in a file system path.

    This is the primary API for JSE 6 compliant TrueZIP applications:
    Like the {{{../truezip-path}TrueZIP Path}} API, this API is just a facade
    for the {{{../truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP Kernel}} API.
    In contrast to the {{{../truezip-path}TrueZIP Path}} API however,
    this API is limited to access the platform file system and any archive
    files within the platform file system.
    In contrast to the {{{../truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueZIP Kernel}} API,
    both APIs are designed to be easy to learn and convenient to use while
    providing a great level of flexibility.
    Because all virtual file system state is managed by the TrueZIP
    Kernel module, this module can concurrently access the same file
    systems than the TrueZIP File* module.

    For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
    file using a
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}}
    like this:

+--+
File file = new TFile("archive.tar.gz/README.TXT");
InputStream in = new TFileInputStream(file);
try {
    // Read the file contents here.
    ...
} finally {
    in.close();
}
+--+

    This example presumes that the JARs of the file system driver modules
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-file/index.html}TrueZIP Driver FILE}}
    and
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-tar/index.html}TrueZIP Driver TAR}}
    are present on the run time class path.

    Mind that a <<<TFile>>> is a <<<File>>>, so you can use it polymorphically.
    However, you cannot use it with a plain <<<File(In|Out)putStream>>> or a
    plain <<<File(Reader|Writer)>>> to access archive entries because these
    classes were not designed for this.
    You have to use a <<<TFile(In|Out)putStream>>> or a
    <<<TFile(Reader|Writer)>>> instead.

    For more examples, please use the Maven archetype for TrueZIP File* module
    applications as described in the
    {{{../kick-start/index.html}Kick-Starting TrueZIP}} section.

* Swing GUI

    This module also provides Swing GUI classes for viewing file trees
    and choosing entries in archive files.
