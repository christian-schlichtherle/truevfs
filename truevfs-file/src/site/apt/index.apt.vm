About TrueVFS File*

    This module provides the <<<TFile*>>> classes
    for simple, uniform, transparent, thread-safe, read/write access to archive
    files as if they were virtual directories in a file system path.

    This is the primary API for JSE&#160;6 compliant TrueVFS applications:
    Like the API of the module {{{../truezip-path/index.html}TrueVFS Path}},
    this API is just a facade for the module
    {{{../truezip-kernel/index.html}TrueVFS Kernel}}.
    In contrast to the TrueVFS Path API however, this API is limited
    to access the platform file system and any archive files within
    the platform file system.
    In contrast to the TrueVFS Kernel API, both APIs are designed to be
    easy to learn and convenient to use while providing a great level
    of flexibility.
    Because all virtual file system state is managed by the TrueVFS
    Kernel module, this module can concurrently access the same file
    systems than the TrueVFS Path module.

    For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
    file using a
    {{{./apidocs/de/truezip/file/TFile.html}<<<TFile>>>}}
    like this:

+--+
File entry = new TFile("archive.zip/dir/HälloWörld.txt");
Writer writer = new TFileWriter(entry);
try {
    writer.write("Hello world!\n");
} finally {
    writer.close();
}
+--+

    This example presumes that the JARs of the driver modules
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-file/index.html}TrueVFS Driver FILE}}
    and
    {{{../truezip-driver/truezip-driver-zip/index.html}TrueVFS Driver ZIP}}
    are present on the run time class path.

    For more examples, please use the Maven archetype for TrueVFS File* module
    applications as described in the
    {{{../kick-start/index.html}Kick-Starting TrueVFS}} section.

* Swing GUI

    This module also provides Swing GUI classes for viewing file trees
    and choosing entries in archive files.
