About TrueZIP Kernel

    This module implements virtual file systems from arbitrary resources,
    manages their state and commits unsynchronized changes if required or
    requested.
    The TrueZIP Kernel uses file system drivers to access these resources.
    It provides multithreading, multiplexing, caching and buffering so that
    the file system drivers do not need to take care of this.

    In contrast to the modules
    {{{../truezip-path/index.html}TrueZIP Path}}
    or
    {{{../truezip-file/index.html}TrueZIP File*}},
    the API of this module is more complex to use, yet very extensible because
    it relies on Dependency Injection for the resolution of
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsDriver.html}file system drivers}}
    and
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/socket/IOPool.html}I/O entry pools}}.
    It also provides service locators for
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/sl/FsDriverLocator.html}file system driver providers}}
    and
    {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/socket/sl/IOPoolLocator.html}I/O entry pool providers}}
    in order to enable applications to resolve these dependencies easily at
    runtime.

    There is no tutorial for how to write a file system driver yet,
    but there's comprehensive Javadoc:

    * If you are going to write a federated file system driver
      (i.e. archive driver), please consult the Javadoc for
      {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/archive/FsArchiveDriver.html}<<<de.schlichtherle.truezip.fs.archive.FsArchiveDriver>>>}}.

    * If you are going to write a non-federated file system driver,
      please consult the Javadoc for
      {{{../apidocs/de/schlichtherle/truezip/fs/FsDriver.html}<<<de.schlichtherle.truezip.fs.FsDriver>>>}}.

    For examples, please consult the {{{../source-repository.html}source code}}
    for the file system drivers which ship with TrueZIP.
