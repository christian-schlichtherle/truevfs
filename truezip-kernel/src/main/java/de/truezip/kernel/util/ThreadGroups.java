     * Determines a suitable thread group for <i>server threads</i> which

     * <p>
     * When a server thread gets spawned from a client thread and no particular
     * thread group is selected, then it gets inherited from the client thread
     * to the server thread.
     * However, this may be inappropriate if the server thread has a longer
     * life time than the client thread or if it's shared by other client
     * threads in different thread groups.
     * This method can then get used in order to determine a suitable thread
     * group for the server thread.
     * <p>
     * This method searches for the top level accessible parent thread group by
     * calling {@link #getThreadGroup()} and walking up the parent thread group
     * hierarchy until the next parent does not exist or is inaccessible.
     * If there is a security manager installed, then this method typically
     * returns its directly associated thread group because this is the only
     * accessible one.
     * Otherwise, this method typically returns the root thread group.

     *         thread group, starting with the thread group of the security
     *         manager if installed or else the thread group of the current
     *         thread and walking up the parent thread group hierarchy until
     *         the next parent does not exist or is inaccessible.
