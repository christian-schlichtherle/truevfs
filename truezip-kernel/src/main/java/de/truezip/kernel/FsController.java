/**
 * An abstract class which provides read/write access to a file system.
 * Objects of this class are typically organized in a chain of responsibility
 * for file system federation and a decorator chain for implementing different
 * aspects of the management of the file system state, e.g. locking concurrent
 * access.
 * 
 * <h3>General Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@link FsModel#getMountPoint() mount point} of the
 * {@link #getModel() file system model} addresses the file system at the head
 * of this chain of federated file systems.
 * Where the methods of this abstract class accept a
 * {@link FsEntryName file system entry name} as a parameter, this MUST get
 * resolved against the {@link FsModel#getMountPoint() mount point} URI of this
 * controller's {@link #getModel() file system model}.
 * 
 * <h3>Transaction Support</h3>
 * <p>
 * Even on modern computers, I/O operations are inherently unreliable: They
 * can fail on hardware errors, network timeouts, third party interactions etc.
 * In an ideal world, we would like all file system operations to be truly
 * transactional like some relational database services.
 * However, file system have to cope with really big data, much more than most
 * relational databases will ever see.
 * Its not uncommon these days to store some gigabytes of data in a single
 * file, for example a video file.
 * However, buffering gigabytes of data just for an eventual rollback of a
 * transaction is still not a realistic option and considering the fact that
 * faster computers have always been used to store even bigger data then its
 * getting clear that it never will be.
 * Therefore, the contract of this abstract class strives for only limited
 * transactional support as follows.
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Generally all file system operations may fail with either a
 * {@link RuntimeException} or an {@link IOException} to respectively indicate
 * wrong input parameters or a file system operation failure.
 * Where the following terms consider a failure, the term equally applies to
 * both exception types.
 * <li>
 * With the exception of {@link #sync}, all file system operations SHOULD be
 * <i>atomic</i>, that is they either succeed or fail completely as if they had
 * not been called.
 * <li>
 * All file system operations MUST be <i>consistent</i>, that is they MUST
 * leave their resources in a state so that they can get retried, even after a
 * failure.
 * <li>
 * All file system operations SHOULD be <i>isolated</i> with respect to any
 * threads which share the same definition of the implementing class, that is
 * two such threads SHOULD NOT interfere with each other's file system
 * operations in any other way than the operation's defined side effect on the
 * stored data.
 * In general, this simply means that file system operations SHOULD be
 * thread-safe.
 * Note that some factory methods declare this as a MUST requirement for their
 * generated file system controllers, for example
 * {@link FsDriver#controller} and {@link FsCompositeDriver#controller}.
 * <li>
 * All file system operations SHOULD be <i>durable</i>, that is their side
 * effect on the stored data SHOULD be permanent in the parent file system or
 * storage system.
 * <li>
 * Once a call to {@link #sync} has succeeded, all previous file system
 * operations MUST be durable.
 * Furthermore, any changes to the stored data in the parent file system or
 * storage system which have been made by third parties up to this point in
 * time MUST be visible to the users of this class.
 * This enables file system operations to use I/O buffers most of the time and
 * eventually synchronize their contents with the parent file system or storage
 * system upon a call to {@code sync}.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @param  <M> the type of the file system model.
 * @see    FsManager
 * @see    <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119: Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</a>
