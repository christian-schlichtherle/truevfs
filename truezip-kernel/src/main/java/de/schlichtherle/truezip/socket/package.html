        <p>Provides I/O sockets to address and resolve targets for I/O
            operations.
            Similar to network sockets, I/O sockets are a very powerful
            concept: They support input, output, copying, caching, proxying
            etc. of the contents of a generic <i>local target</i> and an
            optional <i>peer target</i>.
            By using I/O sockets, you'll never have to write a fast
            {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.socket.IOSocket#copy copy} routine
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to maximize the versatility of I/O sockets, it's highly
            recommended for any implementation that it performs any I/O
            initialization lazily.
            That is, creating a socket should never throw a
            {@link java.io.IOException}.
            If initializing I/O is required, it should be done in any of the
            methods provided by the socket instead.
