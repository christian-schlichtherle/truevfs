            This API implements virtual file systems for contents from
            arbitrary sources, maintains their state and commits unsynchronized
            changes of the contents to federated file systems if required or
            requested.
            It's also the nexus between federated file system applications and
            providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This API is more complex to use than the TrueZIP File* API, but
            very versatile because of its extensible architecture, e.g. it uses
            Dependency Injection wherever reasonable.
            It enables applications to access non-federated file systems other
            than the platform file system and any member file systems.
            For example, an application could access an entry within an archive
            file which is located at a web site using a URI like this:
            {@code zip:http://acme.com/archive.zip!/entry}.
