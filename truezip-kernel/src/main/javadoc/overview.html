        <p>This module is the nexus between federated file system applications
            and providers.</p>
        <p>It establishes virtual file systems from arbitrary sources,
            maintains state and commits unsynchronized changes to the contents
            of federated file systems if required or requested.</p>
        <p>This module does not depend on other TrueZIP modules.</p>
