/**
 * Similar to {@code javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream} with some exceptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This implementation is based on Bouncy Castle's lightweight crypto API
 *     and uses a {@link BufferedBlockCipher} for ciphering.
 * <li>The {@link #cipher} used for encryption or decryption is accessible to
 *     subclasses.
 * <li>The {@code flush()} method just flushes the underlying output stream
 *     and has no effect on the cipher.
 * <li>A {@link #finish()} method has been added to allow finishing the output
 *     (probably producing padding bytes) without closing the output.
 *     This could be used in a subclass to produce a trailer with additional
 *     information about the ciphered data (e.g. a MAC).
 * </ul>
