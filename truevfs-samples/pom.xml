    <name>TrueVFS Samples</name>
    <description>
        Sample applications to demonstrate the usage of various TrueVFS module
        APIs.

        Some of these samples use rather advanced or exotic features which
        makes them more complex than necessary for a typical application.

        By design, the sample applications use all file system drivers which
        can be located at runtime.
        Location of the available file system drivers is performed by
        scanning the class path - see the Javaodoc for the TrueVFS Kernel class
        de.truevfs.kernel.sl.FsDriverLocator for more information.

             However, declaring it as a compile time dependency allows the
             application to set the class for visual and audible feedback when
             entering wrong passwords.

        <!-- A TrueVFS application typically has a dependency on one or more
             file system driver modules for accessing their respective file
             system types.
             When using the client APIs, file system drivers get automatically
             enumerated on the class path at run time by a service locator
             singleton, so adding a run time dependency is sufficient for
             accessing the respective file system types.
             These sample applications have some compile time dependencies
             however because they directly configure and inject some drivers.
