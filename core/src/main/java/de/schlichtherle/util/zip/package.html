            A drop-in replacement for the classes in the package
            <code>java.util.zip</code> which read and write ZIP files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classes in this package read and write ZIP files according to
            a subset of PKWARE's
            <a target="zipdoc" href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">
                ZIP File Format Specification
            </a>,
            Version 6.3.2 from September 28, 2007.
            The subset has been selected in order to achieve the following
            objectives:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Full interoperability with ZIP files read or written by the
                package <code>java.util.zip</code> of Sun's Java SE 6
                implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for reading and writing ZIP64 extensions with the
                following restrictions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The offsets in ZIP64 files must respect a preamble if
                        present, i.e. they must by exact.
                        This is in contrast to ZIP32 files where the offsets
                        do not need to respect a preamble if present.
                        Preambles are primarily used to contain self extracting
                        (SFX) executable code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum file size is {@link java.lang.Long#MAX_VALUE}
                        ({@value java.lang.Long#MAX_VALUE}).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The maximum number of entries in the Central Directory
                        is {@link java.lang.Integer#MAX_VALUE}
                        ({@value java.lang.Integer#MAX_VALUE}).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for arbitrary character sets, in particular
                IBM Code Page 437 (alias IBM PC) for PKZIP compatibility
                and UTF-8 for Java Archive (JAR) compatibility.
                Note that using any other character set except CP437 or UTF-8
                is strongly discouraged because it will result in
                interoperability issues with third party tools, especially
                when interchanging archive files between different locales!
            </li>
            <li>
                {@link de.schlichtherle.util.zip.ZipFile} supports reading
                archive data from the random access read only interface
                {@link de.schlichtherle.io.rof.ReadOnlyFile},
                which allows to read archive data from complex data sources
                such as RAES encrypted ZIP files directly without the need to
                decrypt these to a temporary file first (see package
                <code>de.schlichtherle.crypto.io.raes</code>).
