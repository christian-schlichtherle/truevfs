/**
 * Drop-in replacement for {@link java.util.zip.ZipFile java.util.zip.ZipFile}.
 * <p>
 * Where the constructors of this class accept a <code>charset</code>
 * parameter, this is used to decode comments and entry names in the ZIP file.
 * However, if an entry has bit 11 set in its General Purpose Bit Flag,
 * then this parameter is ignored and "UTF-8" is used for this entry.
 * This is in accordance to Appendix D of PKWARE's ZIP File Format
 * Specification.
 * <p>
 * This class is able to skip a preamble like the one found in self extracting
 * archives.
 * <p>
 * The entries returned by this class are instances of
 * <code>de.schlichtherle.util.zip.ZipEntry</code> instead of
 * <code>java.util.zip.ZipEntry</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is no <code>getName()</code> method because this method
 * would be meaningless when reading archive data from a {@link ReadOnlyFile}.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
