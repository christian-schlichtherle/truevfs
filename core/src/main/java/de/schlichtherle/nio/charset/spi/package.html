A custom implementation of the &quot;IBM437&quot; character set.
This is the original IBM PC character set for the USA, also known as
&quot;CP437&quot;, and is used as the default charset by TrueZIP's archive
driver for the ZIP file format.
<p>
This implementation is required because this character set may not be
installed in the JRE.
In Sun's JRE, if installed, it's contained in <code>lib/charsets.jar</code>
in the JRE home directory.
