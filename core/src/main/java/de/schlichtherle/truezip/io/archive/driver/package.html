        <p>The interface for pluggable {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.io.archive.driver.ArchiveDriver}s.
            The interfaces and classes in this package are used by some client
            classes in order to access archive files without requiring to know
            the archive type.</p>
        <p>To implement support for a custom archive type, developers must
            implement the interfaces in this package and either provide a
            custom implementation of the
            {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.io.archive.detector.ArchiveDetector}
            interface or preferrably register their driver classes with the
            {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.io.archive.driver.registry.GlobalArchiveDriverRegistry}
            class.</p>
