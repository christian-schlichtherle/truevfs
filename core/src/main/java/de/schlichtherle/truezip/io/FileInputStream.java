/**
 * A drop-in replacement for {@link java.io.FileInputStream} which
 * provides transparent read access to archive entries as if they were
 * (virtual) files.
 * All file system operations in this class are
 * <a href="package-summary.html#atomicity">virtually atomic</a>.
 * <p>
 * To prevent exceptions to be thrown subsequently, client applications
 * should always close their streams using the following idiom:
 * <pre>{@code 
 * FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
 * try {
 *     // access fis here
 * } finally {
 *     fis.close();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that for various (mostly archive driver specific) reasons, the
 * {@code close()} method may throw an {@code IOException}, too.
 * Client applications need to deal with this appropriately, for example
 * by enclosing the entire block with another {@code try-catch}-block
 * <p>
 * Client applications cannot read from an entry in an archive file if an
 * automatic update is required but cannot get performed because other
 * {@code FileInputStream} or {@code FileOutputStream} instances
 * haven't been closed or garbage collected yet.
 * A {@link FileBusyException} is thrown by the constructors of this class
 * in this case.
 * <p>
 * Whether or not a client application can read from more than one entry
 * in the same archive archive file concurrently is an implementation
 * detail of the respective archive driver.
 * As of version 6.5, all archive drivers provided by TrueZIP don't restrict
 * this.
 * However, custom archive drivers provided by third parties may do so.
 * <p>
 * If a client application tries to exceed the number of entry streams
 * supported to operate on the same archive file concurrently, a
 * {@link FileBusyException} is thrown by the constructors of this class.
 * <p>
 * If you would like to use this class in order to copy files,
 * please consider using the {@code *copy*} methods in the {@link File}
 * class instead.
 * These methods provide ease of use, enhanced features, superior performance
 * and require less space in the temp file folder.
