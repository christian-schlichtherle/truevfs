/**
 * A simple interface for entries in an archive.
 * Drivers need to implement this interface in order to allow TrueZIP to
 * read and write entries for the supported archive types.
 * <p>
 * Implementations do <em>not</em> need to be thread safe:
 * Multithreading is addressed in the package {@code de.schlichtherle.truezip.io}.
 *
 * <h3><a name="entryName">Requirements for Archive Entry Names</a></h3>
 * <p>
 * TrueZIP 6 has the following requirements for archive entry names:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An entry name is a list of directory or file names whichs elements
 *     are separated by single separators ({@link #SEPARATOR}).
 * <li>An empty string ({@code &quot;&quot;}), a dot
 *     ({@code &quot;.&quot;}), or a dot-dot ({@code &quot;..&quot;})
 *     is not permissible as a directory or file name.
 * <li>If an entry name starts with a separator, it's said to be
 *     <i>absolute</i>.
 *     Absolute entries are not accessible by client applications, but are
 *     retained if the archive is updated.
 * <li>If an entry name ends with a separator, it denotes a directory
 *     and vice versa.
 * </ol>
 * For example, {@code &quot;foo/bar&quot;} denotes a valid entry
 * name for a file, but {@code &quot;./abc/../foo/./def/./../bar/.&quot;}
 * would not, although both refer to the same entry.
 * <p>
 * As another example, {@code &quot;dir/&quot;} denotes a valid entry
 * name for a directory, but {@code &quot;dir&quot;} would not.
 * <p>
 * If an archive driver is to be written for an archive type which does not
 * support these requirements, an adapter for the entry name must be
 * implemented.
 * <p>
 * For example, the ZIP and TAR file formats conform to all but the second
 * requirement.
 * So the driver implementations for the archive types use
 * {@link de.schlichtherle.truezip.io.util.Paths#normalize(String, char)} to remove
 * any redundant elements from the path.
 * <p>
 * It's hoped that these requirements can be relaxed, but this would imply
 * some minor changes in the service provider interface for archive drivers,
 * so it's not going to happen in this major version number.
 *
 * @see de.schlichtherle.truezip.io.util.Paths#normalize(String, char) A utility
 *      method to remove empty and dot and dot-dot elements from an archive
 *      entry name
