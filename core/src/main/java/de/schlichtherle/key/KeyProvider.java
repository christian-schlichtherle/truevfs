package de.schlichtherle.key;

/**
 * A general purpose interface used by client applications to retrieve a
 * key which is required to create or open a protected resource.
 * Both the key and the protected resources may be virtually anything:
 * The minimum requirement for a key is just that it's an {@link Object}.
 * Protected resources are not even explicitly modelled in this interface.
 * So in order to use it, an instance must be associated with a protected
 * resource by a third party - this is the job of the {@link KeyManager} class.
 * Because the protected resource is not modelled within this interface,
 * it is at the discretion of the provider implementation whether its
 * instances may or may not be shared among protected resources.
 * If they do, then all associated protected resources share the same key.
 * <p>
 * For the following examples, it helps if you think of the protected
 * resource being an encrypted file and the key being a password.
 * Of course, this interface also works with certificate based encryption.
 * <p>
 * Once an instance has been associated to a protected resource, the client
 * application is assumed to use the key for two basic operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A key is required in order to create a new protected resource or
 *     entirely replace its contents.
 *     This implies that the key does not need to be authenticated.
 *     For this purpose, client applications call the method {@link #getCreateKey}.
 * <li>A key is required in order to open an already existing protected
 *     resource for access to its contents.
 *     This implies that the key needs to be authenticated by the client
 *     application.
 *     For this purpose, client applications call the method {@link #getOpenKey},
 *     followed by a call to {@link #invalidOpenKey} if the authentication of
 *     the returned key failed for some reason.
 * </ol>
 * If the same resource is accessed multiple times, these basic operations
 * are guaranteed to return a key which compares {@link Object#equals equal},
 * but is not necessarily the same.
 * In fact, the standard implementations in this package try to return a
 * clone of the key wherever possible for maximum security.
 * Failing that, the same key is returned.
 * <p>
 * From a client application's perspective, the two basic operations may be
 * executed in no particular order. Following are some typical use cases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A new protected resource needs to be created.
 *     In this case, just the first basic operation is applied.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to be
 *     completely replaced.
 *     Hence there is no need to retrieve and authenticate the existing key.
 *     In this case, just the first basic operation is applied.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to be
 *     read, but not changed.
 *     This implies that the existing key needs to be retrieved and
 *     authenticated.
 *     In this case, just the second basic operation is applied.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to be
 *     read and then only partially updated with new contents.
 *     This implies that the existing key needs to be retrieved and
 *     authenticated.
 *     Because the contents are only partially updated, changing the key
 *     is not possible.
 *     In this case, just the second basic operation is applied.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to be
 *     read and then entirely replaced with new contents.
 *     This implies that the existing key needs to be retrieved and
 *     authenticated before it is probably (at the provider's discretion)
 *     replaced with a new key.
 *     In this case, the second and then the first operation is applied.
 * </ol>
 * As you can see in the last example, it is at the discretion of the key
 * provider whether or not {@link #getCreateKey} returns a key which compares
 * equal to the key returned by {@link #getOpenKey} or returns a completely
 * different (new) key.
 * Ideally, a brave provider implementation would allow the user to control this.
 * In fact, this is the behaviour of the {@link PromptingKeyProvider} in
 * this package and its user interface class(es).
 * <p>
 * Note that provider implementations must be thread safe.
 * This allows clients to use the same provider by multiple threads
 * concurrently.

     * <b>Important:</b> From a client application's perspective, a
     * <code>KeyProvider</code> is not trustworthy!
     * Hence, the key returned by this method must not only get authenticated,
     * but the client application should also throttle the pace for the
     * return from a subsequent call to this method if the key is invalid

     * As a rule of thumb, at least three seconds should pass between the
     * immediate call to {@link #invalidOpenKey} and the return from the
     * subsequent call to this method.
     * "Friendly" implementations of this interface should duplicate this
     * behaviour in order to protect client applications which do not obeye
     * these considerations against abuses of the key provider implementation.
