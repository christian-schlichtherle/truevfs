/**
 * A "friendly" implementation of {@link KeyProvider} which prompts the user
 * for a key for its protected resource, enforcing a three seconds suspension
 * penalty if a wrong key was provided.
 * The user is prompted via an instance of the {@link PromptingKeyProviderUI}
 * user interface which is determined by the default instance of
 * {@link PromptingKeyManager} as returned by {@link KeyManager#getInstance}.
 * <p>
 * Like its base class, this class does not impose a certain run time type
 * of the key.
 * It is actually the user interface implementation which determines the run
 * time type of the key provided by {@link #getCreateKey} and
 * {@link #getOpenKey}.
 * Because the user interface implementation is determined by the singleton
 * {@link PromptingKeyManager}, it is ultimately at the discretion of
 * the key manager which type of keys are actually provided by this class.
 * <p>
 * Unlike its base class, instances of this class cannot get shared
 * among multiple protected resources because each instance has a unique
 * {@link #getResourceID() resource identifier} associated with it.
 * Each try to share a key provider of this class among multiple protected
 * resources with the singleton {@link KeyManager} will be prosecuted and
 * sentenced with an {@link IllegalStateException} or, at the discretion of
 * this class, some other {@link RuntimeException}.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread safe.
