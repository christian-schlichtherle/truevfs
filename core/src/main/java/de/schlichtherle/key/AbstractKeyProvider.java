/**
 * This abstract class implements the base functionality required to be a
 * "friendly" {@link KeyProvider}.
 * Each instance of this class maintains a single key, which can be of any
 * run time type (it is just required to be an {@link Object}).
 * A clone of this key is returned on each call to {@link #getCreateKey}
 * and {@link #getOpenKey}.
 * Cloning is used for all array classes and all classes which properly
 * implement the {@link Cloneable} interface.
 * The class remains abstract because there is no meaningful template
 * implementation of the {@link #invalidOpenKeyImpl()} method.
 * <p>
 * Other than the key, this class is stateless.
 * Hence, instances may be shared among multiple protected resources,
 * causing them to use the same key.
 * However, this feature may be restricted by subclasses such as
 * {@link PromptingKeyProvider} for example.
 * <p>
 * This class is thread safe.
