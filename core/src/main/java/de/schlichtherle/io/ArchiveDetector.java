/**
 * Detects archive files solely by scanning file paths -
 * usually by testing for file name suffixes like <i>.zip</i> or the
 * like.
 * Whenever an archive file is recognized, the
 * {@link #getArchiveDriver(String)} method returns an instance of the
 * {@link ArchiveDriver} interface which allows to access it.
 * <p>
 * <code>ArchiveDetector</code> instances are assigned to <code>File</code>
 * instances in the following way:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If an archive detector is explicitly provided as a parameter to the
 *     constructor of the <code>File</code> class or any other method which
 *     creates <code>File</code> instances (e.g. <code>listFiles(*)</code>),
 *     then this archive detector is used.
 * <li>Otherwise, the archive detector returned by
 *     {@link File#getDefaultArchiveDetector} is used.
 *     This is initially set to the predefined instance {@link #DEFAULT}.
 *     Both the class property and the predefined instance can be customized.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * An archive file which has been recognized by an archive detector is said
 * to be a <i>prospective archive file</i>.
 * On the first read or write access to a prospective archive file, TrueZIP
 * checks its <i>true state</i> in cooperation with the {@link ArchiveDriver}.
 * If the true state of the file turns out to be actually a directory or not
 * to be compatible to the archive file format, it's said to be a <i>false
 * positive</i> archive file.
 * TrueZIP implements the appropriate behavior for all read or write
 * operations according to the true state.
 * Thanks to this design, TrueZIP detects and handles all kinds of false
 * positives correctly.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must be (virtually) immutable and hence thread safe.
 * <p>
 * Rather than implementing <code>ArchiveDetector</code> directly, it's easier
 * to instantiate or subclass the {@link DefaultArchiveDetector} class.
 * This class provides a registry for archive file suffixes and archive drivers
 * which can be easily customized via configuration files or Java code.
 * <p>
 * Since TrueZIP 6.4, although it's not required, it's recommended for
 * implementations to implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface,
 * too, so that {@link de.schlichtherle.io.File} instances which use it can
 * be serialized.
