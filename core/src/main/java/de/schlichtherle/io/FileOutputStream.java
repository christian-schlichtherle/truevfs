/**
 * A drop-in replacement for {@link java.io.FileOutputStream} which
 * provides transparent write access to archive entries as if they were
 * (virtual) files.
 * All file system operations in this class are
 * <a href="package-summary.html#atomicity">virtually atomic</a>.
 * <p>
 * To prevent exceptions to be thrown subsequently, client applications
 * should always close their streams using the following idiom:
 * <pre><code>
 * FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
 * try {
 *     // access fos here
 * } finally {
 *     fos.close();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that for various (mostly archive driver specific) reasons, the
 * <code>close()</code> method may throw an <code>IOException</code>, too.
 * Client applications need to deal with this appropriately, for example
 * by enclosing the entire block with another <code>try-catch</code>-block.
 * <p>
 * Client applications cannot write to an entry in an archive file if an
 * automatic update is required but cannot get performed because other
 * <code>FileInputStream</code> or <code>FileOutputStream</code> instances
 * haven't been closed or garbage collected yet.
 * A {@link FileBusyException} is thrown by the constructors of this class
 * in this case.
 * <p>
 * Whether or not a client application can write to more than one entry
 * in the same archive archive file concurrently is an implementation
 * detail of the respective archive driver.
 * As of version 6.5, all archive drivers provided by TrueZIP don't restrict
 * this.
 * However, custom archive drivers provided by third parties may do so.
 * <p>
 * If a client application tries to exceed the number of entry streams
 * supported to operate on the same archive file concurrently, a
 * {@link FileBusyException} is thrown by the constructors of this class.
 * <p>
 * If you would like to use this class in order to copy files,
 * please consider using the <code>*copy*</code> methods in the {@link File}
 * class instead.
 * These methods provide ease of use, enhanced features, superior performance
 * and require less space in the temp file folder.
