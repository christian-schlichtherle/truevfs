/**
 * Represents a chain of exceptions thrown by the {@link File#umount} and
 * {@link File#update} methods to indicate an error condition which
 * does <em>not</em> incur loss of data and may be ignored.
 * 
 * <p>Both methods catch any exceptions occuring throughout their processing
 * and store them in an exception chain until all archive files have been
 * updated.
 * Finally, if the exception chain is not empty, it's reordered and thrown
 * so that if its head is an instance of <code>ArchiveWarningException</code>,
 * only instances of this class or its subclasses are in the chain, but no
 * instances of <code>ArchiveException</code> or its subclasses (except
 * <code>ArchiveWarningException</code>, of course).
 *
 * <p>This enables client applications to do a simple case distinction with a
 * try-catch-block like this to react selectively:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * try {
 *     File.umount();
 * } catch (ArchiveWarningException warning) {
 *     // Only warnings have occured and no data has been lost - ignore this.
 * } catch (ArchiveException error) {
 *     // Some data has been lost - panic!
 *     error.printStackTrace();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
