/**
 * A base class for any class which wants to decorate a {@link ReadOnlyFile}.
 * <p>
 * Note that subclasses of this class often implement their own virtual file
 * pointer.
 * Thus, if you would like to access the underlying <code>ReadOnlyFile</code>
 * again after you have finished working with the
 * <code>FilteredReadOnlyFile</code>, you should synchronize their file
 * pointers a'la:
 * <pre>
 *     ReadOnlyFile rof = new SimpleReadOnlyFile(new File("HelloWorld.java"));
 *     try {
 *         ReadOnlyFile frof = new FilteredReadOnlyFile(rof);
 *         try {
 *             // Do any file input on brof here...
 *             frof.seek(1);
 *         } finally {
 *             // Synchronize the file pointers.
 *             rof.seek(frof.getFilePointer());
 *         }
 *         // This assertion would fail if we hadn't done the file pointer
 *         // synchronization!
 *         assert rof.getFilePointer() == 1;
 *     } finally {
 *         rof.close();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * This does not apply to this base class, however.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses implemententing their own virtual file pointer should add a note
 * referring to this classes Javadoc like this:
 * <blockquote>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class implements its own virtual file pointer.
 * Thus, if you would like to access the underlying <code>ReadOnlyFile</code>
 * again after you have finished working with an instance of this class,
 * you should synchronize their file pointers using the pattern as described
 * in {@link FilterReadOnlyFile}.
 * </blockquote>
