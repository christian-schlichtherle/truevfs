/**
 * An archive driver which reads and writes Self Executable (SFX/EXE) ZIP
 * files.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Modifying SFX archives usually voids the SFX code in the
 * preamble!
 * This is because most SFX implementations do not tolerate the contents of
 * the archive to be modified (by intention or accident).
 * When executing the SFX code of a modified archive, anything may happen:
 * The SFX code may be terminating with an error message, crash, silently
 * produce corrupted data, or even something more evil.
 * However, an archive modified with this driver is still a valid ZIP file.
 * So you may still extract the modified archive using a regular ZIP utility.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable.
