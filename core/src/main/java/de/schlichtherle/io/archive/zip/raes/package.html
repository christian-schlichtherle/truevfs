            Provides the {@code ArchiveDriver} family for RAES encrypted ZIP
            files.
            RAES encrypted ZIP files are no more than regular ZIP files
            which use UTF-8 as their character set (like JARs) and have been
            wrapped as a whole in the RAES file format.
            RAES enables transparent random access to AES encrypted data in the file as
            if the application were reading decrypted data from a
            {@link java.io.RandomAccessFile}.
            RAES is not at all specific to ZIP files - any kind of content can be
            encrypted.
            TrueZIP uses RAES to enable transparent access to encrypted ZIP files as if
            they were (virtual) directories.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access RAES encrypted ZIP files, client applications need to
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                configure TrueZIP to recognize the file suffixes
                registered for this archive type with the
                {@link de.schlichtherle.io.DefaultArchiveDetector} class
                (which are <i>.tzp</i>, <i>.zip.rae</i> and <i>.zip.raes</i>
                by default),
                and
            </li>
            <li>
                have the JAR for Bouncy Castle's Lightweight Crypto API for
                JDK 1.4 Version 1.30 or higher (<i>lcrypto.jar</i>) on the
                runtime class path.
                You can download it by searching for "lcrypto-jdk14-130" at
