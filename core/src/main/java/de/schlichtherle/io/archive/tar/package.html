        <p>The archive driver family for TAR files.</p>
        
        <p>To access these archive types, client applications need to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>configure TrueZIP to recognize the file suffixes
                registered for these archive types with the
            {@link de.schlichtherle.io.DefaultArchiveDetector} class, and</li>
            <li>have the JAR for Apache's Ant, version 1.6.5 or higher
                (<i>ant.jar</i>) on the runtime class path.
                For BZIP2 compression, version 1.7.0 is required for stability
                and to pass the unit tests.
                You can download it at <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">
            http://ant.apache.org</a>.</li>
