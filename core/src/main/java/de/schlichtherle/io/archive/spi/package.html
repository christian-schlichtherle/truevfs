            The Service Provider Interface (SPI) for pluggable archive drivers.
            The interfaces and classes in this package are used by some package
            private classes in the package {@code de.schlichtherle.io} in order to
            access archive files without requiring to know the archive type.
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement support for a custom archive type, developers must
            implement the interfaces in this package and either provide a custom
            implementation of the {@link de.schlichtherle.io.ArchiveDetector}
            interface or register the driver class with the
            {@link de.schlichtherle.io.DefaultArchiveDetector} class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some classes in this package are provided to ease the task of
            implementing an archive driver.
