/**
 * Thrown if an archive entry cannot get accessed because either
 * (a) the client application is trying to input or output to the same archive
 * file concurrently and the respective archive driver does not support this,
 * or
 * (b) the archive file needs an implicit unmount which cannot get performed
 * because the client application is still using some other open streams for
 * the same archive file.
 * <p>
 * In order to recover from this exception, client applications may call
 * {@link File#umount()} or {@link File#update()} in order to force all
 * entry streams for all archive files to close and prepare to catch the
 * resulting {@link ArchiveBusyWarningException}.
 * A subsequent try to create the archive entry stream will then succeed
 * unless other exceptional conditions apply.
 * However, if the client application is still using a disconnected stream,
 * it will receive an {@link ArchiveEntryStreamClosedException} on the next
 * call to any other method than <code>close()</code>.
