/**
 * Similar to <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>
 * with the following differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This class requires J2SE 1.4 only.
 * <li>This class performs better than its overengineered colleague in JSE 1.5.
 * <li>This class provides locks which provide a different set of methods
 *     (with the same functionality in the common subset) in order to suit
 *     the particular needs of TrueZIP (see {@link ReentrantLock}).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> In accordance with JSE 1.5, upgrading a read lock to a write
 * lock is not possible. Any attempt to do so will lock the current thread.
 * This is a constraint which can't be fixed properly: If this constraint
 * would not exist, two reader threads could try to upgrade from a read lock
 * to a write lock concurrently, effectively dead locking them.
 * By locking this thread immediately on any attempt to do so, this is
 * considered to be a programming error which can be easily fixed without
 * affecting any other thread.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, it is possible to downgrade from a write lock to a
 * read lock. Please consult the JSE 1.5 Javadoc of the class
 * <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>
 * for more information.
