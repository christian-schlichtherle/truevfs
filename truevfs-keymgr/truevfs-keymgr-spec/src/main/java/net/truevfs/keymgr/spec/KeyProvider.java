/**
 * Manages the life cycle of a generic secret key for reading and writing
 * protected resources.
 * A key provider is usually (but not necessarily) associated to one or more
 * protected resources by a {@link KeyManager}.
 * <p>
 * Clients typically use the secret key for the encryption and authentication
 * of protected resources.
 * However, neither the protected resources nor their encryption or
 * authentication operations are modelled by this interface.
 * Instead, clients are assumed to use it for the following purposes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The method {@link #getWriteKey} returns the secret key for writing a
 *     protected resource.
 *     This implies that the secret key does not need to get validated by the
 *     client.
 * <li>The method {@link #getReadKey} returns the secret key for reading a
 *     protected resource.
 *     This implies that the secret key needs to get validated by the client.
 * <li>The method {@link #setKey} sets the secret key programmatically.
 *     This can get used after a call to {@link #getReadKey} in order to update
 *     some properties of the secret key after it has been validated by the
 *     client.
 * </ol>
 * The methods of this interface may get executed in arbitrary order.
 * Calling the same method subsequently is guaranteed to return a key which at
 * least compares {@link Object#equals equal}, but is not necessarily the same.
 * <p>
 * Following are some typical use cases:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A new protected resource needs to get created.
 *     In this case, {@link #getWriteKey} needs to get called.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to get
 *     completely replaced.
 *     Hence there is no need to retrieve and validate the secret key.
 *     Again, {@link #getWriteKey} needs to get called.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to be
 *     read, but not changed.
 *     This implies that the secret key needs to get retrieved and validated.
 *     In this case, just {@link #getReadKey} needs to get called.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to get
 *     read and then only partially updated with new contents.
 *     This implies that the secret key needs to get retrieved and validated.
 *     Because the contents are only partially updated, changing the secret key
 *     is not possible.
 *     Again, just {@link #getReadKey} needs to get called.
 * <li>The contents of an already existing protected resource need to get
 *     read and then entirely replaced with new contents.
 *     This implies that the secret key needs to get retrieved and validated
 *     before it may optionally get replaced (at the provider's discretion)
 *     with a different secret key.
 *     In this case, first {@link #getReadKey} and then {@link #getWriteKey}
 *     need to get called.
 * </ol>
 * As you can see in the last example, it is at the discretion of the key
 * provider implementation whether or not {@link #getWriteKey} returns a secret
 * key which compares {@link Object#equals equal} to the secret key returned by
 * {@link #getReadKey} or returns a completely different secret key.
 * Typically, a provider implementation enables the user to control this.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must be safe for multi-threading.
 *
 * @param   <K> The type of the secret keys.
