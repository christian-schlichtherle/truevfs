About

    Driver modules provide services to extend the
    {{{../truevfs-kernel/index.html}TrueVFS Kernel}}
    with support for a particular type of file system.
    Driver modules advertise their services on the class path in order to
    make them locatable by the
    {{{../truevfs-kernel/index.html}TrueVFS Kernel}}
    at runtime.
